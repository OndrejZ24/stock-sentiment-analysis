raytoei,Death and Taxes. Service Corporation International $SCI ,1724773571,1f2kctk,0,2,"Hello, 

in 1989, Peter Lynch wrote about Service Corporation International in this book, ""One up on Wall Street"". This a slow growth Funeral Services company, and he considered this company a very good investment, and he mentioned it in chapter 8 under ""The Perfect Stock"". 

I wanted to find out, 30+ years on, whether this company is still a good investment candidate.  

I have decided to do up a datasheet +  a Lynch Stock-chart and copy and paste an excerpt from the book  on SCI.

=============

**A couple of comment of SCI:**

- This is a slow growth company and the business follows the demographic growth of the population. The company is also buying and consolidating funeral homes, and also buying back massive amount of their stock. In the last 10 years, they retired 30% of the outstanding shares, see the spreadsheet in 2. 

- The business is boring, top line sales growth is around 5% CAGR, but EPS growth is around 6.5% to 12%  on a forward basis, in the past they have managed 9% - 20% annualized growth. 

- Because the business is stable, the company has debt of around 9 nears of earnings. The cash flow is also very stable, the Free Cash flow margin is around 12-13%. 

- I did a reverse NPV and worked out that at the current price of around $77, the market is expecting an EPS growth of only 5.5% a year.

- My blended valuation puts the company around $63-$69 which isnt far off from the share price, Morningstar's quantitiative valuation puts it around $73

- The company pays a dividend of only 1.5% but has been growing the dividend every year at around 13%.

- In terms of total shareholder return, i calculate it as Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth, which is around 9-10% a year. This a general guideline of what to expect if you were to invest in $SCI.

Now, if there’s anything Wall Street would rather ignore besides toxic waste, it’s mortality. And SCI does burials.

For several years this Houston-based enterprise has been going around the country buying up local funeral homes from the mom-and-pop owners, just as Gannett did with the small-town newspapers. SCI has become a sort of McBurial. It has picked up the active funeral parlors that bury a dozen or more people a week, ignoring the smaller one-or two-burial parlors.

At last count the company owned 461 funeral parlors, 121 cemeteries, 76 flower shops, 21 funeral product-and-supply manufacturing centers, and 3 casket distribution centers, so they’re vertically integrated. They broke into the big-time when they buried Howard Hughes.

Currently they are working towards profitability in two ways. They are closing down the poorest performing stores and they are returning to extreme bargains. This is a profitable model once used by them and currently use by stores like Ollie's and TJ Maxx.

Seth Marks has been hired as SVP of extreme value sourcing. He served as Big Lots’ vice president of merchandising from 2004 to 2007.

In April, BIG increased its borrowing capacity by $200 Million. About three quarters of its debt is not long term, but lease obligations. These should be reduced as stores are closed.

I believe that this retail store is different from those like Bed Bath because hunting deals is much more appealing in person. Ollies is currently doing well doing exactly what Big is returning to.

Jim90009,Inflation and declining indexes are double edged advantage to the buyer of stock indexes.,1723937660,1euva1z,0,11,"# Declining Market in an Inflationary Environment: A Dual Advantage for Investors

A declining market in an inflationary environment can be intimidating, but it also offers unique opportunities for investors who can navigate the situation strategically. The concept of a ""double-edged sword"" in this context means that both aspects of the scenario—declining prices and inflation—can work to your advantage if you understand how to capitalize on them. Here's how:

# 1. Understanding the Decline: Why Markets Fall in an Inflationary Environment

* **Rising Interest Rates**: In response to inflation, central banks typically raise interest rates to control price increases. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for companies, which can slow down expansion and reduce future earnings prospects. This often leads to a decline in stock prices as investors anticipate lower growth.
* **Investor Sentiment**: Inflation erodes purchasing power, and when combined with rising interest rates, it can dampen consumer spending and business investment. Investors might react by selling off stocks, leading to a market decline. The immediate reaction to inflation is often negative, reflecting fears of reduced profitability and economic slowdown.

# 2. The First Edge: Buying at Lower Prices

* **Discounted Valuations**: As markets decline, stock prices often fall below their intrinsic value. Inflation-induced sell-offs can cause temporary dislocations where high-quality companies are undervalued. For investors, this means the opportunity to purchase stocks at prices significantly lower than their long-term value.
* **Enhanced Future Returns**: The principle of buying low and selling high is fundamental to investing. In an inflationary downturn, when prices are depressed, entering the market can set you up for substantial gains when the market recovers. The lower your entry price, the higher your potential returns when prices eventually rise.
* **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: If you invest regularly, a declining market allows you to accumulate more shares at lower prices. This reduces your average cost per share, positioning you to benefit more when the market rebounds. In an inflationary environment, where prices may be volatile, this strategy can be particularly effective.

# 3. The Second Edge: Inflation’s Effect on Revenues and Earnings

* **Revenue Growth Through Inflation**: While inflation can initially hurt stock prices, it also leads to higher nominal revenues for companies. As prices for goods and services rise, companies typically adjust their pricing to reflect these increases. This means that over time, businesses can generate more revenue simply because they are charging more.
* **Earnings Growth**: Companies that can manage their costs effectively and pass on higher prices to consumers will not only maintain their profit margins but may also see their earnings grow in nominal terms. Even though inflation might reduce the real value of money, the increase in nominal earnings can drive stock prices higher once the market stabilizes.
* **Inflationary Tailwinds**: If inflation is persistent across the economy, it often means that there is more money circulating. This increased money supply can lead to higher overall demand, supporting company sales even as prices rise. As companies report higher earnings due to inflation, their stock prices are likely to recover and even exceed previous levels.

# 4. The Broader Economic Context: Inflation Is Everywhere

* **Inflation Across Sectors**: Inflation doesn't just affect one part of the economy; it's pervasive. While certain sectors (like consumer staples or energy) may benefit more directly, inflationary pressures generally increase the nominal value of goods and services across the board. This widespread impact means that most companies will eventually adjust their pricing, leading to revenue growth.
* **Real Asset Appreciation**: Stocks represent ownership in real companies that produce good",ValueInvesting,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1euva1z/inflation_and_declining_indexes_are_double_edged/

Going for 8-9 times earnings now and has dropped a good amount recently. They just announced earnings and lowered volume guidance slightly. The market didn’t like it evidently - the stock fell 6-7%. 

This is a good business with a big moat. If the stock price keeps getting hit, it’s a no brainer to go in and buy. Full disclosure I own the company, bought it back when it was 6 times earnings but haven’t bought lately because it spiked to a value that was harder to stomach than 6x. 

Key points are the following:

1. Huge moat - only they can bottle Coca Cola in 10-15 countries in the Middle East 

2. Coca Cola owns a big chunk of the company

3. Coca Cola is an incredible brand that will always be around

4. Many of the countries that the company has the bottling rights to are GROWING in population. Over time this should result in more Coca Cola products being consumed

5. Inflation resistant - if inflation is high, they just raise prices. Consumption is relatively predictable 

6. The business operates in many different countries, providing some diversification outside of Turkey

ThatOneGuy012345678,Thoughts on Haidilao,1724390579,1ez4tc0,0,9,"Haidilao is a Chinese hot pot restaurant chain that is synonymous with hot pot in China. They have \~1400 locations and offer hot pot as an 'experience' more than a place to just consume calories. They have their own boy band, dancing servers, and amenities like manicures for people in their huge lines.

They went public in 2018 and went on a store opening binge, opening hundreds of stores a year, even through COVID. They assumed that it would be temporary and short-lived, so even during COVID they were opening 1 store a day.

Unfortunately, this rapid expansion and China's zero COVID policy caught up to them, and they stopped making any net income. They had to take on tons of debt, and slim down their business, eventually closing \~300 locations and 'right sizing' the chain. This largely wrapped up in 2023 where they went back to making a great net income, with a net income of 4.5B RMB on 41.5B RMB of revenue (11% net margin). They pay a massive 6.7% dividend. They've focused on paying down debt the last few years, and 'recovering' from their binge. Debt is now a very manageable amount, and not a concern (in my opinion).

A human comes and takes orders initially, but at most locations, you order on a tablet, and a robot will bring you your food later. The back of the restaurant is also highly automated, and in areas with dense restaurants, some food is prepped offsite.

Their business model is about as simple as it gets for a restaurant. The only thing they 'cook' is the broth, which they can make in huge quantities. The rest is literally providing you with raw ingredients to cook yourself. If we put on our 'investor thinking cap', their business model is to basically 'rent' you a table, bring you raw ingredients, and have you cook it yourself. Because their revenue per table, and turnover rate is so high, they only pay \~1% of their revenue in rent, so even this is not much of a cost. Their capital costs consist of basically buying some tables for a restaurant, and they are extremely CAPEX light. I calculate that stores pay for themselves, in revenue at least, within \~1 month of opening.

Although they've shown the ability to open hundreds of stores in a year, their focus for 2024 is:

1. Slowly expand overseas in the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe opening only 10 stores per year abroad. I believe they could far exceed this and still be quite profitable, but they are probably in the 'infrastructure building' phase where they are making the cookie cutter mold perfect, rather than deploying it as fast as possible.
2. They are experimenting with a new Hailao brand that is cheaper than Haidilao, but also lacks some of the performances, perks, etc... Hailao is simply a place to get hot pot, it is generally around half the price for the ingredients, but since it's so much cheaper, people order much more food and bills are usually only 23% lower than Haidilao. Of course, it is also cheaper for Haidilao to run, and represents a great way to expand to more budget conscious consumers.
3. They are offering franchising in China now, for the first time, and experimenting with this for new locations.
4. They are trying to expand into Tier 3 Chinese cities, and increase density in existing Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities.

As for political risk, I can't imagine US/China trade tensions extending to a hot pot restaurant chain. I view the risk of tarrifs as being quite low, as opposed to something like steel manufacturing, EVs, national security industries, etc... I just can't see anyone on either side having strong opinions about a hot pot chain.

They are currently valued at a PE of 13, which seems incredibly low for a business like theirs. Their stock is trading near all time lows. Mid-year financials are going to be reported soon, and we are 8 months past the last reporting period - so today's PE ratio might already be under 13 considering the last report was for the period ending December 31, 2023.

stephiegrrl,McDonald's? Hideously overpriced or am I just underestimating their moat?,1724394882,1ez5wkw,0,56,"Hi everyone. Beginner investor and first time poster in an investment sub. Please be kind, but honest.

I know this is titled ""Stock Analysis"", but basically I've looked at the basic fundamentals of McDonald's because I haven't learned how to apply Benjamin Graham's formula yet. Truth be told, I haven't made it to chapter 11 of the book yet, but this matters to me because my wife has been sitting on a giant stake in McDonald's because investing is not her deal, and she wants me to figure out what to do with it, because investing is my deal. I have the time, I'm developing the temparament, I have the analytical ability, I have a healthy fear of the unkown which I mitigate by learning everything I can before I make a decision, and then making sure I have a factor of safety built in to cover the known and unkown unknowns. I'm the lady who spends a week researching microwaves before buying one because I want to maximize quality and value.

  
Sorry, that intro was a bit too long, but basically, my wife and I have a fortune in McDonald's, and I'm almost but not quite at the level of being afraid McDonald's could file Chapter 11 before I make it to Chapter 11 of The Intelligent Investor, and here's why.

1. Stocks in general are trading at much higher valuations than what I'm comfortable with.

2. It seems like we're heading for either a recession or the bursting of an AI tech bubble within days to months but I'd be shocked if one or both of these didn't happen within 18 months.

3. McDonald's is at a P/E > 25 which is about the max I feel comfortable spending on a large cap growth stock, but I don't believe McDonald's is a growth stock, but as you will see in a later bullet, McDonald's thinks they're a growth stock.

4. Much more important/troubling to me is the debt/""literally anything"" ratio (debt/equity, debt/capital, etc.) and the price to book. Price to book is severely negative because they have more liabilities than assets.

5. Allegedly their problem is they've gotten too expensive and ""those damn Gen Z kids"" just don't appreciate a good fast burger at a cheap price.

6. The way McDonald's seems to be addressing this problem and their 2 consecutive earnings misses is by investing a billion dollars, which they apparently borrowed at God knows what kind of bond rates, to open a fuck ton of new restaurants in Ireland and the UK (thus they are behaving as if they are a growth stock, but they're already a giant) not to mention that part of the reason they 

7. A ton of Wallstreet analysts are extremely bullish on it, but among a couple of the firms I have the most confidence in, the one whose analysis I find to be the most disciplined and value/fundamental based has them rated as sell. Among the firms I depend upon to help me with my own analysis, this firm also has a very high rating of being right more often when it comes to fast food restaurants (as rated by yet another analytical firm I rely upon because I'm just as disciplined in who I listen to as I am in how I analyze a product because I see an analyst/firm as a product/tool)

8. There is very small but growing short interest in McDonald's stock.

9. Their bonds are rated BBB+ which is still ""investment grade"" but isn't that a bit low for a company who has done so well for so long?

10. The share price is very close to the lower price targets offered by the bullish analysts; however if the most bullish price targets are right it has another 10-20% upside which given how much McDonald's is at stake for us, just that increase would be a nice annual salary (and a very difficult argument she and I would be having if the fundamentals didn't improve before it hit that target).

Bottom line, all stocks appear to be trading way more on speculative value than actual earnings potential, McDonald's appears to be overvalued for any other company, they have a lot of debt, they appear to be desperately trying to buy their way out of a mess with massive amounts of debt, and the reasonin",ValueInvesting,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ez5wkw/mcdonalds_hideously_overpriced_or_am_i_just/

**Key Emotional Factors**

**(1) Fear and Panic**

Fear can lead to massive stock price declines, often triggered by investors anticipating unfavorable economic conditions or market downturns, resulting in a panic-induced asset liquidation.

**(2) Greed and Overconfidence**

During economic booms, greed can lead to inflated stock prices due to overconfidence in market stability and future growth prospects, thereby artificially increasing asset values.

**(3) Optimism and Pessimism**

Positive economic news boosts market participation and higher stock prices, while pessimistic outlooks reduce investment and prices decline due to negative economic indicators.

**(4) Herd Mentality**

Investors' herd mentality can amplify market trends, leading to pronounced fluctuations, such as asset prices rising beyond intrinsic value but crashing when sentiment shifts.

The analysis of stock price trends during previous recessions reveals valuable patterns.

**The Great Depression (1929-1939)**

The 1973-1975 recession, marked by stagflation and the oil crisis, resulted in a 50% decline in the S&P 500, causing a significant drop in investor sentiment and stock prices.

**The Early 1980s Recession**

The 1980-1982 economic downturn was primarily due to tight monetary policy, causing a 16% drop in the Dow Jones and reducing consumer spending and industrial production.

**The Dot-Com Bubble (2000-2002)**

The dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, leading to a significant bear market, with the NASDAQ Composite losing 78% of its value from 2000 to 2002, largely due to overvaluation of tech stocks and speculative investments.

**The Great Recession (2007-2009)**

The Great Recession, triggered by the subprime mortgage crisis and Lehman Brothers collapse, resulted in a severe global economic downturn, with the S&P 500 falling 57% between 2007 and 2009.

**COVID-19 Pandemic Recession (2020)**

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant market downturn in early 2020, with the S&P 500 dropping over 30%. However, unprecedented fiscal and monetary interventions led to a swift recovery.",ValueInvesting,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ez5yyl/analyzing_market_reactions_during_economic/

Murky_Obligation_677,"Analysis: Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.",1724409325,1ez9fpd,0,7,"I stg most of you idiots look at the same 5 stocks. Every fucking post in this entire sub is about Lulu, Nike, Mag 7, Starbucks, or Ulta. And the worst part is none of you even know what you’re talking about. Every post is “I’m thinking of buying Ulta because it’s down 50%, thoughts?” Or “I like Amazon because it grows” DON’T YOU THINK THE ENTIRE FUCKING WORLD IS THINKING THE EXACT SAME THING WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU POSSIBLY GONNA KNOW ABOUT THESE 50b OR 100b or 1T COMPANIES THAT THE REST OF THE ENTIRE WORLD DOESN’T KNOW??????

I digress. 

I typically don’t share my analysis here because I don’t want something I’m buying getting bid up. However, I’ve built my position in this company over the past couple months (it’s now close to a third of my account), so I figured I’d have nothing to lose by showing you buffoons what a real thesis looks like. Please, feel free to bid the price up at this point or comment why I’m wrong but I guarantee I’ll cook your logic. Here it is:

Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of pistols, revolvers, and rifles. The company was founded in 1852 and is listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol SWBI. Its market cap is ~$670m and it has virtually no debt.

The firearms industry is generally overlooked because of its unpredictability and politicization:
1) Firearm spending is discretionary and cyclical. This leads to lumpy returns for manufacturers and a stock that doesn't ""screen"" well. 
2) The US is divided when it comes to firearms. Polarization regarding the subject has led to an uncertain regulatory outlook and one side of the aisle dismissing the industry as evil.

1) Cyclicality should not be a deterrent in itself. The problem with most cyclical industries is the infighting and value destruction that comes with the inevitable downturns. The firearms manufacturers stay rational during downcycles for a couple of reasons. First, they rarely face inventory impairments so they're not incentivized to chase unprofitable volume. Second, many of the manufacturers utilize flexible 3p production models that allow them to rapidly adjust to shifts in demand. Finally, the industry is an oligopoly so there's more to be gained from focusing on margins than market share. Both Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger (the only public firearms manufacturers) have been profitable in every single year over the past 20 years (on a free cash flow basis, which I define as operating income plus depreciation & amortization minus capital expenditures and the impact of any one-time items). 

2) Since the turn of the century, firearm ownership has become increasingly controversial. The primary point of contention today is whether it should be legal to manufacture/sell/possess assault rifles and large-capacity magazines (~60% of S&W's business). Most investors acknowledge this uncertainty, deem it a risk, and call it a day. What's rarely considered is the fact that this uncertainty actually drives demand. Since the 2000s, the domestic non-military firearms market excluding shotguns has roughly doubled in size from ~$2b to ~$4b. It's likely that much of this growth can be attributed to consumers' perception of a possible decrease in supply going forward. Furthermore, I'm skeptical that a ban on assault weapons or large-capacity magazines would have much of a material effect effect on the size of the firearms market. This is because demand has historically exploded whenever there's an event that scares or pisses off the industry's customer base. 

Now, consider the following:

Attractive valuation:
Because the firearms business is highly cyclical, I average Smith & Wesson's results through each cycle to arrive at an average earning power. I define each cycle as beginning in the year after the market size peaks and ending on the next peak. During the last two cycles (which spanned from 2015-2022), Smith & Wesson averaged $160m in pre-tax free cash flow. If we apply a 21% tax rate we arrive at an average after-tax free ",ValueInvesting,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ez9fpd/analysis_smith_wesson_brands_inc/

The best advice was tied to how to calculate a ""value"" stock. It is not simply this stock has a very low price compared to what it was 3-4 years ago and is a long time established company. I would have made that mistake before reading some info on this sub.

I would have bought stocks a few months ago that continue to drop hard. Looking closer at their numbers it makes sense since even though they are long term established businesses , things changed and you can not just take the name and a low price compared to 3-4 years ago as a reason to sell. You have to do the research and if you can't do the research or don't want to, then as this sub has said before, just buy an index.

WeatherWealth,How many meteorologists missed the boat in the collapse of natural gas prices,1708014132,1arja3n,0,1,"Many other meteorologists have ""missed"" the boat not calling for this huge collapse in natural gas prices. I see nothing to foster a major rally. Other than a brief buy recommendation I had for WeatherWealth clients, ahead of the polar vortex 3-4 weeks ago, I have touted that El Nino and record warm global oceans brought on by climate change would NOT create consistent cold weather and would be bearish natural gas since $3.00 !!!! **The inverse natural gas ETF (KOLD) is up a whopping 100% this winter.**  
Some folks keep taking about stratospheric warming and have been wrong.  
The stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere about 6-30 miles above Earth's surface. Usually in winter, the stratosphere gets extremely cold.But sometimes a sudden ""stratospheric warming"" event happens when the stratosphere rapidly warms by up to 90°F in just a few days!  
The stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere about 6-30 miles above Earth's surface. Usually in winter, the stratosphere gets extremely cold. But sometimes a sudden ""stratospheric warming"" event happens when the stratosphere rapidly warms up to 90°F in just a few days! The top part can wobble and destabilize the whole vortex. When those vortex pieces swing down, they can funnel bitter-cold Arctic air to lower latitudes for weeks or months.  
So stratospheric warming high above us can ultimately lead to much colder winter weather and big snowstorms especially across North America and Northern Europe, thousands of miles away from the initial warming! However, NOT this February or March. El Nino and record-warm global oceans will prevent any consistent cold weather through March.  
[This blog](https://www.bestweatherinc.com/weather/weather-refuses-to-rescue-natural-gas-and-grain-traders-from-the-hungry-bears/) I wrote explains more and why I was bearish natural gas for most of the winter and what to expect for March. Enjoy

tickeron_community,Artificial Inteligance (AI) Transforms Pattern Recognition in Stock Markets,1708015865,1arjyxy,0,1,"In the intricate world of financial trading, understanding and capitalizing on market patterns stand as a pinnacle of strategy. These patterns, which are deeply rooted in the psychology of market participants, offer insights into the potential movements of financial instruments. In this context, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way traders approach market patterns. AI-driven tools, such as Pattern Search Engine (PSE), are at the forefront of this transformation.  
  
The Sophistication of Trading Patterns  
  
Trading patterns are among the most sophisticated strategies in the financial markets. They are not mere reflections of price movements but are deeply interwoven with the psychological underpinnings of market behavior. Recognizing these patterns requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and a keen eye for detail.  
  
AI in Trading: A Game-Changer  
  
The role of AI in trading patterns is transformative. AI systems like Tickeron’s PSE are designed to teach traders to recognize patterns, including both entry and exit points. This is achieved by leveraging the power of AI to analyze vast amounts of data, a task that is humanly impossible to accomplish with such speed and accuracy.  
  
The Power of Pattern Search Engine (PSE)  
  
PSE stands out in its ability to analyze 39 types of patterns across various assets like stocks, penny stocks, ETFs, and Forex pairs. This tool offers a comprehensive solution by allowing traders to customize settings such as confidence levels, price ranges, and asset classes. Moreover, PSE enhances user experience by providing options for setting up email or push notifications, ensuring that traders do not miss any critical trading opportunities.  
  
Ease of Use and Accessibility  
  
Using PSE is designed to be user-friendly. Traders can select various criteria such as the types of patterns, minimum confidence levels, and the assets they wish to track. The AI then takes over, performing complex tasks like finding patterns, determining breakout and target prices, and backtesting. This process culminates in the AI providing valuable statistics and potential trade impacts directly to the user's inbox.  
  
Alternative for Beginners: AI Robots  
  
For those who may not feel comfortable customizing their own settings, Tickeron offers AI Robots, like Swing Traders, which come with minimal trade requirements per day. These robots are a great way for beginners to dip their toes into the world of AI-driven trading without feeling overwhelmed by the complexities of customization.  
  
Real-Time Pattern Trading  
  
Tickeron's Real-time Patterns feed (RTP) is another remarkable tool, scanning thousands of stocks and ETFs every minute. This tool allows users to select from various time frames and patterns, with the AI providing predictions on target prices, breakout prices, and confidence levels.  
  
The integration of AI in financial trading, particularly in pattern recognition, marks a significant leap forward. Tools like Tickeron’s PSE and RTP are redefining the landscape, making sophisticated trading strategies more accessible and efficient. As the financial world continues to evolve, the synergy between AI and trading patterns will undoubtedly become a cornerstone of successful trading strategies.  
  
Sergey Savastiouk, the founder of Tickeron, captures the spirit of the modern era in pattern trading with his statement: “We’re in a new and thrilling era of pattern trading investing—we’re excited to facilitate access to this success.” The introduction of RTP and PSE marks a significant shift in the trading landscape, offering sophisticated analysis and insights to everyday investors in an unprecedented way.",investing,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1arjyxy/artificial_inteligance_ai_transforms_pattern/

* **Tracking their investments**: If you've invested $25k in each startup, how can you track them? Bth the financial amount and the startup's progress
* **Exiting sooner than a liquidity event**: Is it possible to transfer your shares you got as an angel investor sooner than a liquidity event (e.g. another funding round) by the startup? Like sell your shares to another investor or exchange them for another startup lol
* **People just assume you're rich by default**: Noticed in some events when someone says I'm an angel investor, founders rush into them asking for >$100k. Is that normal?

My understanding is they give you the option to buy the shares at a ""cheaper"" price before the expiration date, which by then they are worthless.

My question is how do I buy said shares? I've bought the warrants on Fidelity, is there something the company has to do with the warrants to allow share holders to buy or sell them? Because as of right now I can buy more warrants or sell them at the current warrant price. The information I've found through google has been somewhat confusing.",investing,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aprmjv/question_on_warrants_and_expiration/

BrockForsey,40K in traditional IRA. Should I transfer to my Roth IRA?,1721474597,1e7tfbb,0,3,"Potentially relevant details: 36 yo, married, 24% income tax bracket. 

Through previous work 401Ks, I have about 40K in a Traditional IRA. Wondering if I should transfer to my Roth IRA, which has around 20K in it. 

I was told by a FA to not transfer because the taxes would’ve been penal at the time. I can afford to pay it now. But it is nice to have a chunk of cash in case life happens. 

But my plan is to max out my Roth IRA every year and kind of treat the Traditional IRA like it isn’t there. I also contribute 15% into a work Roth 401K. 

I’ve read that future income is important in this. I work in a pretty volatile industry. So it wouldn’t surprise me at any point I’m told my services are no longer needed. And there wouldn’t be a guarantee that I ever find work in it again. But that also doesn’t mean I won’t have 25 more years if that makes sense. It’s just kind of a random, volatile industry. 

I’m sure this gets asked a lot. But any advice would be appreciated. ",investing,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1e7tfbb/40k_in_traditional_ira_should_i_transfer_to_my/

They said that 1 dollar could only buy 1 dollar worth of stock so buying the stock itself wouldn't be able to push the price enough, however, with 1 dollar you could buy options that could affect 10 or potentially 20 dollars worth of the underlying stock, therefore there is natural leverage in those securities.

simplegreen99,Selling of 401k Stock vs Vested stock,1721751808,1eac2n8,0,34,"Question for the collective. My company (a fortune 10) offers a 401k which I've been invested in for well over 15 years, in that 401k they are heavily invested well... in themselves.. They also provide stock as part of your bonus each year, so as a result I have a bunch of stock in the 401k and a bunch of stock in my normal portfolio.

  
I'm over invested and continue to find ways to diversify.  Stock is at an all time high and is continuing to climb.

  
Speaking with my financial advisor on possible areas to spread out, he recommended liquidating just the company stock out of my 401k and into another fund we've been discussing over the past few months.

That said, I still have a lot of fully vested stock in my personal stock portfolio from years of bonuses. About 9 months ago, I sold off a lot of my ""Long Held"" (vs short) company stock. But i still have triple the long held stock (in value) in my portfolio vs my 401k.

So my question is (not that i doubt my advisor he's done very well for me) is it better to sell off whats in the 401k and roll it into another fund (which from what i read doesnt take a tax hit but i could be wrong) or should i liquidate more of my long held stock in my portfolio and take the capital gains hit.

In my mind it seems like its a wash except the outcome is more diversification either way I choose.

ThePatientIdiot,Is a whole life insurance policy a good place to park money in for people under 30?,1706966421,1ahvyml,0,1,"I am looking for places to park money, mostly gains I earn from trading options on the stock market. The idea is to hide money from myself in vehicles where it will be both hard and impractical to cash out of but at the same time, said vehicles provide me with the flexibility to take loans out against them.  
My basic understanding is that term life insurance is useless because everyone in my family lives to 80+ years old and I am under 30 so a 30 year policy will result in lost money. But a whole life policy allows me the flexibility to take loans against it and it will always pay out when I die. I have no children but want 2-3 in the future.  
I would ideally want to deposit at least $300 monthly, if not weekly. I want the freedom to determine how much I deposit which is why I ideally want a low monthly rate. I will increase it as my profits increase. I am looking for a $1-2m policy. I would also like some kind of exposure to the market with this policy (similar to 401k or index funds especially those with some dividend payouts).

kc_chiefs_,Very random question pertaining to stocks,1707075429,1aiwcih,0,1,"Sorry if this is offtopic in this sub, but I'm very curious about a hypothetical situation.

I'm replaying Grand Theft Auto 5, and there are a series of missions that you can make serious money in (assassination missions) and it got me wondering about real life issues for those scenarios. 

In those missions, the character can invest prior to the mission in a competitor's company, sell the stock after the mission is over, and then reinvest in the company of the person you assassinated. 

So, my question is; if somebody invests in said company, sells after the share price is super high, and then reinvests all the profits (and all the characters money); in real life, what would the ramifications be? Namely, these values are very high, hundreds of millions, what would happen if somebody random decided to invest $100mm, or more, in a company?

Am currently 24; life expectancy is about 75. I estimate about 50 years left to live, which is about 600 months. So 600 monthly rent payments instead of buying a house.  
  
Everyone in my family continues to tell me that buying is always superior to renting no matter the scenario. I'm not quite sure if this applies to my plan.  
  
I understand that buying real estate is powerful for many reasons (5x leverage 20% down, tax advantages, etc.) but what if:  
  
1. I plan to not marry or have any kids.  
  
2. I plan to ""die with zero"" meaning I want to die with as close to 0 dollars as possible since I'm not having any kids to pass any assets down to.  
  
3. I want to ""retire"" from working a job as early as possible.  
  
4. I want to have as little unnecessary stress as possible throughout the lifetime.  
  
  
The money that would have gone into the down payment and monthly mortgage would go to the SP500. Would it be reasonable to think that the SP500 will appreciate more than the real estate property? Or am I misunderstanding?  
  
My thinking with this is:  
  
1. SP500 and renting will have a lot less maintenance (no HVAC guy, no plumber, etc.)  
  
2. No property tax  
  
3. What's the point in building equity in this house if I will not pass it down to anyone? I don't want to die with 1-2 million dollars worth of house.  
  
Some possible arguments I can come up against my own point:  
  
1. monthly mortgage is fixed but rent increases in dollar amount over time (but also take into consideration that SP500 also increases in dollar amount over time)  
  
2. Possibly borrow against value of the home?  
  
3. A 20% down payment allows you to leverage (ex. You put down 200k to control a 1m asset. That's like 5x leverage and you de-leverage with each monthly payment)

wha2les,Thinking of buying Japanese Stock. Can't decide whether to make settled currency in Dollars or Yen,1707263217,1akol5d,0,1,"Hi.  


I asked a similar question a week or so ago, but I think I misunderstood what my brokerage is offering, so I want to see if people here can explain better. I thought having settled currency in Yen was better because it would raise my floor at the risk of lowering my ceiling due to currency fluctuations. But the brokerage person just told me something different (even though another person told me something else a couple of weeks ago when I called).  


So I am thinking of buying Japanese Stock with my US brokerage account. My brokerage account offers settled currency in US Dollars and Japanese Yen.  


I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense have settled currency in Dollars or Yen.   


I thought having settled currency in dollars  meant that my investment in the site dashboard would show the Dollar equivalent when it comes to gains/ losses. So for example if the investment in yen went up 20%, but currency fluctuated where the yen got stronger, my actual investment gain in dollar might only be 15%. Whereas if it was in yen, then i would get the full 20% gain, and I only have the currency risk if i choose to convert.  


As my brokerage account is in US, it is probably more convenient to have things in dollars so that if i sell the investment, i don't need to convert to buy something like an ETF?  


Whereas if it is settled in Yen, I would have to convert back? The way the brokerage people told me was that the settled in yen make sense if you have yen in your account. I don't, but I can use the currency exchange feature to get the yen anyways.  


Does it actually matter in terms of potential gains/ losses or other Pros and Cons? The approximate exchange rate is 1 USD to 150 yen.. That is quite lopsided to the US Dollar... I do expect the yen to strengthen even if it is 1 USD to 120 or 130 yen in the future for example.   


TLDR: does it matter if i make my settled currency in Dollar vs Yen in regards to potential gains/ losses?  


Is there any pro or con that I am not aware of in buying in US dollar or Yen?

The stock is up decently today and it caught my eye. I've done some research and I see a couple of issues that have me thinking about actually selling my holdings instead of adding.

First of all, Visa is certainly a laggard in this last bull run. 

Next, the anti-trust issues. Visa and MC make up a duopoly, undeniably. Things are not looking good for their margins, long term: [https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-visa-mastercard-30-bln-swipe-fee-settlement-2024-06-25/](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-visa-mastercard-30-bln-swipe-fee-settlement-2024-06-25/)

The article basically says that a proposed settlement to this very elongated suit was denied on June 25 by a judge for being too favorable to the CC companies. The judge says that trial is the next step. I don't like that they have to give up even more to merchants or risk trial.

Thirdly, CBDCs.

Central banks have been talking about this a lot recently, especially the ECB, and there are a lot of problems that it would potentially solve. An adoption of CBDCs, such as [project mBridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBridge), would delete Visa and MC as we know them today.

[Project mBridge reaches minimum viable product stage and invites further international participation - June 5, 2024](https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/mcbdc_bridge.htm)

I don't know if these things will affect the share price short-medium term. The problem for me is the downside risk is MASSIVE.

Visa has a tangible book value of -$2.55 per diluted share. Even if I only discount goodwill and count the other $26.243B of intangible assets, I calculate $6.55 per share. In other words, you can't even see the floor its so far away.

I realize I'm not actually making a good case for holding/buying Visa. I have searched the sub about some of these stories and I see a lot of people proposing that they are valid concerns (are bearish on Visa), but I haven't really seen many compelling arguments in the other direction.

I'm not a CFA or a prophet. Just a noob who has been avoiding a lot of nice things like vacations in favor of getting (hopefully) wealthier. My small cap portfolio has outperformed the bigger names, Visa being my largest holding of those, by about 6x since 2021.

Also, I do not own any MC. Visa and RY are my only finance stocks.

The Group needs to improve its operations to arrest the decline. However, it does not have a clear track record of delivering operating improvements.



To deliver a sufficient same margin of safety from the Earnings Value, CJ Century needs to achieve 11% better performance than its past 2 years average. Can it deliver this with just the legacy businesses?



CJ Century ventured into the couriers services sector in 2016 but have since divested this loss making venture. You wonder why it did not tap big into serving the growing online fulfillments services.

It is a mid cap family-controlled holding company that mostly invests in private equity and venture capital (either directly or through funds). On the one hand, I guess one could say that its moat is equal to the moats of its holdings.

Sea-Dark-6353,GCT: GigaCloud's warehouse rental expenses seem suspicious.,1724224609,1exjaha,0,10,"Hello, I am a beginner seeking guidance. I am facing challenges in accurately determining the CAPEX for GigaCloud.

The company's most significant capital expenditure is warehouse rental, which is stated in their recent quarterly report to be approximately $100 million annually. I believe this should be classified as CAPEX and deducted when calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF).

However, the Income Statement already includes rental expenses related to sales under the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) section. The report states: ""Cost of Product sales primarily consist of the purchase price of merchandise, shipping and handling costs for self-owned merchandise, warehouse rental expenses excluding the portion allocated to cost of service revenue and abnormal capacity, packaging fees and personnel related costs.""

My understanding is that this only accounts for the rental space allocated to sold goods. In that case, where are the expenses for rental space allocated to unsold goods accounted for? It doesn't make sense that only the cost of space for sold goods is recognized when the total rental cost is $100 million annually.

Is it possible that the company is concealing expenses?",ValueInvesting,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1exjaha/gct_gigaclouds_warehouse_rental_expenses_seem/

Excellent_Courage333,"CTRN - Citi Trends a decent retailer, risky short position, fairly valued",1724230372,1exko6e,0,1,"I personally think, this stock is over shorted. Just look at the current 13F filings(https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ctrn) . there are about 9.1m shares held by institutions and about 700k shares held by insiders of which the new Interim CEO Ken Seipel bought 573k in July 2024(Holding 4,9% of shares).

That makes 9.8m shares held by individuals or funds who have to report to the SEC.

There are 8.6m shares outstanding or about 113% of shares held thight.

The largest shareholder Fund 1 incresed his holdings from roughly 20% to 30% last quater.

1.72m shares were shorted with a 10 day average trading volume of 100k. That are 17 days for shorts to cover (basically a whole month). They can not exit wthout moving the price. So they are (F\*\*\* up).

$CTRN EV is 80, market cap 130m. They have 55m in cash and authorized buyback for 50m.

This retailer currently loses money but it will not go out of business in the near future. 

If this turnaround is successful and you put in a positive net profit margin like the hisorical average of 2%, wich will lead to 14m net profits it trades at a PE of 9.  EV/EBTDA should be around 4-7.

Momentum is negative and this stock should go down further before it gets better. Margins have to improve.

pravchaw,How do you distinguish Deep Value and Value Traps ?,1724807115,1f2xkzy,0,35,"The difference between a value investment and a value trap mainly lies in their future prospects and underlying fundamentals. A true value investment is a stock that is temporarily underpriced relative to its intrinsic value, with potential for future growth and profitability. It typically features a low price due to temporary factors, consistent or growing cash flow, a strong business plan, quality financial statements, and a price below intrinsic value, providing a margin of safety.

 In contrast, a value trap is a stock that appears cheap based on metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio but is actually a poor investment due to fundamental issues within the business. Warning signs of a value trap include inconsistent profits, struggles with cost management, poor management practices, high debt levels, and declining revenues.

 Ultimately, value investments have strong underlying fundamentals and identifiable catalysts for growth, while value traps face long-term challenges and lack clear paths to improvement. To avoid falling into value traps, investors should conduct thorough fundamental analyses, compare companies to their sector peers, and critically evaluate management's plans and execution, looking beyond simple valuation metrics to assess long-term viability and growth potential.

 However its easy to dismiss many good value investments as value traps.    For example even companies like Microsoft and Walmart at times were dismissed as value traps when for many years the stock price was flat.  Recently I had invested in H&R Block was dismissed as a Value Trap but it turned out to be a great investment.  All have proved to multi-baggers.

 Ultimately you cannot just look at numbers alone and say - this is a value trap.  You have to identify a solid qualitative issue, i.e. if it in a secularly challenged industry such as a department store or a brick & mortar pharmacy.  There is a plausible case to be made that companies like Macy's and Kohls may be value traps due to competition from e-commerce.  Or companies like Walgreen Boots Alliance and CVS due to pressure from Pharmacy Benefit Managers.  Others may be tobacco companies such as Altria and BTI given government policy against tobacco.  Other value traps may be the oil and gas infrastructure if panic develops over climate change and global warming and governments get serious on the issue.  This will leave many companies stranded.

So what are your criteria of distinguishing between a deep value - contrarian opportunity and value trap?",ValueInvesting,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1f2xkzy/how_do_you_distinguish_deep_value_and_value_traps/
2centswithinflation,“Value” Investing,1724807358,1f2xnx0,0,14,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about what value means. This should be obvious, but if the market is trading at largely overvalued multiples, you’ll have a hard time finding “value” plays. They still exist, but they’ll be largely unknown companies you’ve never heard of.  Mag7 stocks can be value, but most analysts would agree they aren’t at these prices. However, if the price crashes and or future growth expectations increase, there could be value.

Value is just getting more for your money. It’s buying things that will pay themselves back in shorter time than other investments. Treasury bills are close to 5%, so if you find a stock that’s p/e is low and has high expected growth - you’ve found value. 

A lot of people say that’s a growth stock. Yeah, you can be growth and value. That’s pretty obvious. You can also just be a value stock if earnings are paying you back more than 5-10% per year.

I think many of you have not been in the market long enough to understand that there will be crashes and there will be opportunities to buy things cheap, so if you can’t find value now, maybe just be patient.

Rich_Minimum_2888,Unveiling Powermatic: A Hidden Gem with High Margins and Real Estate Upside,1724812302,1f2zbyi,0,2,"**Powermatic Data Systems Limited (Ticker: BCY)**

Powermatic Data Systems presents a fascinating opportunity: a profitable, cash-rich business trading at a valuation close to its adjusted asset value. How can such an undervalued situation exist? This is precisely why I challenge the efficient market theory and resonate more with Warren Buffett's view that markets are often driven by irrational emotions rather than logic.

Buffett’s analogy of ""Mr. Market"" perfectly encapsulates this phenomenon: ""Mr. Market is your partner in investing. He is a man with incurable emotional problems. On some days, he is euphoric and sees only favourable factors affecting his business. On other days, he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead. If you are a prudent investor, you will want to buy from Mr. Market when he is depressed and sell to him when he is euphoric.""

# Business Snapshot

Powermatic, based in Singapore, specialises in wireless connectivity products. As stated in their 2024 annual report, “Our portfolio of high-quality wireless products, from modules to embedded boards and antennas, is designed to elevate connectivity, optimize efficiency, and enhance productivity.” These components are essential in enabling real-time communication between machines, allowing data to be managed effectively across various industries, from healthcare to industrial IoT.

Between FY2019 and FY2024, Powermatic achieved a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% in revenue and 9% in profit before tax (excluding a one-time charge of $5.8 million in FY2024). This steady growth is further reinforced by their recent launch of Wi-Fi 7 Dual-Band Dual-Concurrent Modules, which promises enhanced wireless performance and power efficiency.

# Moats: Competitive Advantages

1. **Exclusive Qualcomm Partnership:** Powermatic, through its subsidiary Compex, is one of only 10 Qualcomm Authorized Design Centers (ADC) globally and the only one in Southeast Asia. This exclusive relationship allows Powermatic to design advanced wireless connectivity solutions, providing it with a significant technological edge and industry credibility.
2. **High-Margin, Niche Market:** Powermatic focuses on high-performance, specialized markets such as industrial IoT, healthcare, and security. This focus on niche, high-margin sectors helps it avoid the intense price competition seen in more commoditized segments of the wireless market.
3. **Strong Financial Position:** With no debt and substantial cash reserves, Powermatic is well-positioned to invest heavily in R&D, pursue strategic acquisitions, and withstand market downturns, giving it a solid financial advantage over more leveraged competitors.
4. **Intellectual Property and Expertise:** Over the years, Powermatic has developed significant expertise in wireless connectivity technologies, coupled with proprietary technology and design capabilities. This expertise acts as a barrier to entry for new competitors.
5. **Customer Relationships and Reputation:** As a trusted supplier with a long-standing presence in the wireless connectivity market, Powermatic enjoys strong relationships with its customers. These relationships are difficult for new entrants to disrupt, especially in industries where reliability and long-term partnerships are crucial.

While Powermatic may not have the widest moat, its strategic partnerships and niche focus give it a solid competitive edge. Given these factors, a valuation of around 10x adjusted P/E seems reasonable. Excluding the one-time charge, FY2024 profit before tax would have been S$12.1 million, representing a 4% improvement over FY2023. However, digging deeper reveals an asset almost equal to the company’s market cap.

# The Real Estate Angle

The real kicker lies in Powermatic’s real estate holdings. In 2009, they acquired a property at 7 Harrison Rd for around $19 million—an investment that has appreciated significantly. By 2023, management recognized the property’s value and decided t",ValueInvesting,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1f2zbyi/unveiling_powermatic_a_hidden_gem_with_high/

Who owns the underlying companies. ,1708018040,1arkuv9,0,40,"I just learned this myself, a bit embarrassingly late, that vanguard is owned by it's investors. So in that case, if I invested in a vanguard fund, then I should also be the partial owner in the company in relation to my percentage ownership of the fund? Eg, if the fund owns 100 shares of apple, and I own 1 percent of the fund, then I own 1 share of apple. Of course in reality the ownership stake would be negligible. 

Is this actually true? And do we not get voting rights in each underlying company due to just how many there are and how insane it would be to tally every single investors vote for every single company, in say the SP500. Or is it because we only own a partial stake in vanguard and it means nothing for the underlying companies they invest in? If someone had a larger, majority stake in a vanguard fund, would they have voting rights, or am I missing something?

Next question is about BlackRock. It's a public company. So if I invest in a BlackRock fund, who is the owner partially, of the underlying companies?

CaffreyEST,Exploring a Potential SPA Center/Hotel Project in Partnership with Local Government,1707913301,1aqlm34,0,1,"Hi everyone,  
I'm reaching out to this community because of a unique opportunity that has caught my attention. A local government here in Estonia is looking for partners to develop a SPA center/hotel, and this announcement really speaks to me both professionally and personally.  
**A Bit About Me:**  
My current business involves supplying promotional goods and items like hotel slippers to various clients, including those in the hospitality industry. This has given me a unique insight into this sector, albeit from a different angle. On top of that, I am a huge SPA fan myself. I've always been drawn to the relaxation, wellness, and the sheer joy that SPA experiences offer.  
**The Opportunity:**  
When I learned about the local government's initiative, it immediately sparked my interest. The idea of being part of creating a new SPA center/hotel — a place where people can find peace, wellness, and relaxation — is incredibly appealing. I see it as a chance to blend my professional background with my personal passion for SPAs.  


**What I'm Hoping to Find Out:**  
Interest and Viability: Does the idea of developing a SPA center/hotel resonate with you? Do you think there's a market for another one, considering the unique angle we could bring?  
Advice on Getting Started: For those who have experience in launching or running a SPA or hotel, what were your initial steps? I'm looking for guidance on how to begin this journey.  
**Building a Team:** Regarding team assembly, I have already started to consider involving locals who have a proven track record of successfully establishing SPA hotels. The idea is to tap into the wealth of experience right here in our community, leveraging their insights and expertise to ensure the success of this new venture.  
**Funding and Investment:** One of the most crucial aspects – I don't currently have the funding to bring this project to life on my own. How do you approach finding and securing funding for such an endeavor? Are there investors out there who might be interested in a wellness-focused project like this? I'm keen to explore all avenues for outside investment, whether it's through traditional financing, venture capital, or crowdfunding.  
**Your Thoughts and Suggestions:** I'm open to any insights, suggestions, or advice you might have. Whether it's about potential challenges, funding strategies, or tips for success, I'm all ears.

There doesn't seem to be a consensus what the stock will do, especially given the fact that the price doesn't really seem to be tied to traditional valuations. I currently have over 300 shares, mostly long-term with a gain of almost 700%. I'm 52 and looking to retire in about 8 years, with an overall net worth (including house) of over $2.5M. Most of my net worth is in a 400k, but I have a non-significant amount tied up in stocks, with Nvidia now representing over 30% of my total stock holdings (not including 401k).

  
I've been considering cashing out a chunk of Nvidia and just putting it in an ETF like VOO to insulate me a bit from any potential massive down-tick in the stock. Unfortunately, most of the ETFs are also heavily invested in the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks, which includes Nvidia. I've also been trying to figure out what a good ""break-even"" type point would be, if I cashed out and took a 20% capital gains hit (federal + state) and how much the stock would need to drop for me to buy back in at a more reasonable price.

WeatherWealth,Why this winter has once again been warm resulting in a spiral down of natural gas prices,1708019504,1arlgfo,0,1,"Many other meteorologists have ""missed"" the boat not calling for this huge collapse in natural gas prices. I see nothing to foster a major rally.  I have touted that El Nino and record warm global oceans brought on by climate change would NOT create consistent cold weather and would be bearish natural gas since $3.00 !!!! The inverse natural gas ETF (KOLD) is up around 100% this winter.

Another reason for the major bearish reaction in natural gas prices is a lack of LNG exports to Europe. European supplies are plentiful in the midst of yet another warm winter and an overreaction to the Russian-Ukraine war a year ago.  
Some folks keep talking about stratospheric warming and have been wrong.  
The stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere about 6-30 miles above Earth's surface. Usually in winter, the stratosphere gets extremely cold. But sometimes a sudden ""stratospheric warming"" event happens when the stratosphere rapidly warms up to 90°F in just a few days!  
The stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere about 6-30 miles above Earth's surface. Usually in winter, the stratosphere gets extremely cold. But sometimes a sudden ""stratospheric warming"" event happens when the stratosphere rapidly warms up to 90°F in just a few days! The top part can wobble and destabilize the whole vortex. When those vortex pieces swing down, they can funnel bitter-cold Arctic air to lower latitudes for weeks or months.  
So stratospheric warming high above us can ultimately lead to much colder winter weather and big snowstorms especially across North America and Northern Europe, thousands of miles away from the initial warming! **However, NOT this February or March. El Nino and record-warm global oceans will prevent any consistent cold weather through March.**

Careful-One5190,How to evaluate CEF share buyback offer (BME),1722073910,1edcpc0,0,1,"I received a tender offer to buy back my shares of Blackrock Health Sciences (BME). This is a CEF that currently trades at a -7.94% discount. I own it for the dividend but the NAV has generally increased over time as well. Current yield is 6.21% and I'm satisfied with this holding and intend to add to my position.

The tender offer is to buy back my shares at 98% of NAV. My first inclination is to accept the offer, which would yield a quick profit of a couple thousand dollars (compared to selling it today). I'm thinking that I could then repurchase those shares, hopefully at a discount greater than -2% and keep the profit.

What's the catch? I understand that I may not be able to repurchase the shares at the same -7.94% discount as today, but it seems likely that it will trade at a greater discount than -2%.

Economic experts are puzzled by these factors, and would think that sometime in ne end of 2024 that we may look to enter a recession -- Something they expected earlier this year.

My question: If we are to begin to hit recession, how do I protect my investment/retirement portfolios (e.g.. 401k. Roth IRA, and taxable income)? Obviously adding bonds and treasuries will help as they pay you interest, but how does it all work (I'll do my due diligence) for those who experienced some near crashes of the market in 1980s and 2008?

I recently sold my TSLA stocks and sitting on $60k (40k in Trad Ira and 20k in Roth). I believe since both are IRA’s, there’s no tax event to worry about.

I still have 35 stocks of TSLA in each of the accounts (at $20 cost basis) that I don’t mind to keep for long term. I need to invest this 60k and also generate income from it through monthly Covered Calls. 

I can either buy 70 shares more and do CC’s on TSLA or add to my SPY (10 stocks) and do CC’s on SPY.

From looking at the options, looks like TSLA will earn me more monthly income. SPY Aug 16 560 at 2.95 versus TSLA Aug 16 240 at 4.05. I can do 1 SPY vs 2 TSLA contracts.

After garnering huge asset flows in 2020 and 2021 (totaling an estimated $29.2 billion), its funds were decimated in the 2022 bear market, with losses ranging from 34.1% to 67.5% for the year. Many of its funds enjoyed a strong rebound in 2023, but that wasn’t enough to offset their previous losses. As a result, the ARK family wiped out an estimated $14.3 billion in shareholder value over the 10-year period—more than twice as much as the second-worst fund family on the list. ARK Innovation alone accounts for about $7.1 billion of value destruction over the trailing 10-year period.

Our company financial advisor is suggesting I rollover my existing 401k, from previous employer, into my current employer’s 401k plan. It seems like sound advice to me. I am 100% committed to my new employer, so I see no risk of leaving/being fired.
 
My existing 401k account is 100% invested in a JP Morgan Target Date Growth Fund (JLGMX) and the fund has been on a tear this past month. My new 401k account has been 100% into the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX). 
 
I’m curious as to what other investors think about my current investments and the funds I’ve chosen. Considering how nice the JP Morgan fund has currently been, would it be wise to rollover or best to stay put seeing as how this fund is not available through my current employer.

But, are there any problems with Warren's extremely simplistic advice and approach to investing? Does he himself truly follow it?

The company is based in China—I’m a believer that the situation there is a generational opportunity, and that any investor should own some exposure to Chinese stocks given with how incredibly cheap they are.

YRD is my China exposure. The company earned $292M in 2023 and grew EPS +16% Y/Y in Q1 2024. Net cash (cash minus total liabilities) is $487M, the current market cap is $421M, and they’ve been profitable every year of their existence besides Covid. 

The business is very easy to understand; they provide consumer credit underwriting, loan acquisition, and other services to banks, insurance companies, and loan companies. In many ways these loans provide consumers with access to everyday credit in the same way credit cards do for Americans. The credit card business isn't as substantial given the limit on interchange fee, which is why these solutions exist. It's a growing industry and the largest player is a private company spun-off of Ant Group, the largest public competitor is Qifu ($QFIN). 

There's been substantial regulation limiting the ability of new players to enter the space since 2019, and the engrained relationship with funding partners creates a stickiness and cost of switching. YRD also provides similar services to insurance companies through its insurance brokerage business and operates an e-commerce platform ancillary to its consumer credit business.

Apokaliptor,Automatic value investing,1723992808,1evb50b,0,4,"Hi,

I am thinking about creating a bot that screens thousands of stocks, does fundamental analysis + calculates “fair price” based on historical grows and reports to me the top results based on fundamentals criteria and valuations.

My ideia would be to invest on top results equally, like a “personal etf”, so let’s say 20 companies that excelled in this automatic fundamental criteria and are at good price vs the calculated fair price.

This sounds cool on paper but also sounds too easy and that anyone could do something like this, so my point with this post is to ask your opinion about this, if this can work long term or if it gives any edge at all? Do you this working? If not what are the reasons?

viliam-ond-,"I’m 13, rate my portfolio",1724246328,1expfoa,0,1,"Hello, I am 13, and I am investing in stocks. I started investing in December 2022, and since then I have learned and made much progress. I saved all the money I got since I was a child, and when I learned about investing I slowly invested almost all of it. My return now is around 100€, my portfolio value is about 930€, and I'm up around 12%. It isn't much but that's because I have deposited most of the money this year. Some stocks I bought 2 years ago are up 50%+ but I only put like 5-10€ in each of them.

I made the mistake of diversifying too much with little money, and I now have 26 holdings. I would rather use Warren Buffett's approach of going all in on big opportunities than some smaller ones. Many people might tell me to invest in the S&P 500 ETF, but I pick specific stocks to learn, learning in this scenario is worth more than the potential financial upside.

Here is my current portfolio, what are your opinions?

NOTE: ""First Buy"" means I bought it at the start when I bought random stocks I liked, mainly big companies

**Bank Of America (BAC) - 12.7% - +9.7%**  
- My first big buy, and my biggest position. I saw Buffett bought it and I looked into it - it seemed like a good buy.

**Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Corporation (SMFG) - 8.5% - +18.3%**  
- I bought during the ""2-day recession"" on 6. and 7. August and it paid off.

**Starbucks (SBUX) - 8.4% - +16.2%**  
- In my opinion, it was undervalued, and the new CEO will help the company so I am not selling.

**Visa (V) - 6.3% - +6.6%**  
- First buy + bought most of it 3 weeks ago as a ""safe buy"" with not much but steady returns.

**Xtrackers Nikkei 225 ETF (XDJP) - 6.2% - +11%**  
- My only ETF, same as SMFG

**Erste Group (EBO) - 5.8% - +16%**  
- I live in Europe, and I liked this bank at the price I bought it at.

**Microsoft (MSFT) - 5.7% - +11.8%**  
- First Buy + added most of it during the ""2-day recession""

**UnitedHealth (UNH) - 5.6% - +19.1%**  
- Same as Visa but I bought it earlier

**Coca-Cola (KO) - 5.3% - +14.7%**  
- Same as UNH

**Walt Disney (DIS) - 4.9% - -15%**  
- My biggest loss I currently hold, but I think they have a solid future so I won't sell

**John Deere (DE) - 4.9% - +1.7%**  
- I think it's a solid company with solid growth, I am not expecting crazy returns

**Raiffeisen Bank (RAW) - 4.7% - -6.4%**  
- This wasn't a good buy, but I think it can get back in black - then I will sell

**Broadcom (AVGO) - 4.4% - +93.6%**  
- I would consider this my best investment, I would sell but Nancy Pelosi holds calls expiring Jan 2025 so I will probably sell then

**Hershey (HSY) - 3.2% -  +7.28%**  
- It was a bit undervalued, nothing crazy so I bought a little

**Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - 2.9% - +28.5%**  
- Nancy Pelosi must be a magician

**Occidental Petroleum - (OXY) - 2.1% - -2.2%**  
- Bought it because Buffett did, I planned on adding more but I never did and now I am glad

**Other Positions - Smaller than 1.5%**  
- Most of them are First Buys  
- ADS, BRK.B, GOOGL, CVX, AAPL, JPM, AXP, ORCL, BLK, XOM

I missed some big opportunities I looked at 2 years ago I found using a screener because I was scared, like CROX and QCOM, and some smaller ones like ZIM and CALM.

Right now I am considering these companies I found with the same screener: H&R Block, Sirius XM, International Money Express, International Seaways, T. Rowe and Match Group

Can you tell me what you think about my portfolio, the companies I am considering and some advice for the future? Thank you in advance!

ButterToastEatToast,Building a Position in Decentralized Energy,1727656404,1fsj2s5,0,2,"
At the risk of stating the obvious, the U.S. energy scene is in dire need of major changes due to aging infrastructure, climate change, and inefficiency. Decentralized energy resources and microgrids, in my opinion, are the solution for creating a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy grid. Several catalysts are converging to accelerate their development and deployment.

# 1. The Need for Grid Resilience

The U.S. electric grid is increasingly fragile, with power outages becoming more frequent and costly. This is due to several factors:

* **Aging Infrastructure:** Many parts of the grid are decades old, some dating back to the early 20th century, making them prone to failures, especially during extreme weather.
* **Climate Change:** More frequent and intense weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and ice storms are damaging power lines and other grid components, causing prolonged outages.
* **Growing Reliance on Renewables:** The shift to cleaner energy sources like solar and wind is beneficial for the environment but complicates grid stability due to their intermittent nature and the difficulty in ensuring load balance.

The impact of these issues is significant:

* **Economic Losses:** Power outages cost the U.S. economy around $150 billion annually.
* **Climate Change**: Between 2016 and 2020, electrical power networks caused 19% of the wildfires that occurred in those five years. While the exact costs are unavailable, they are reasonably estimated to be in the billions.
* **Inefficiency:** The centralized grid is extremely inefficient, with around two-thirds of energy lost from generation to delivery.
* **Increasing Outages:** Power outages have increased by 64% from 2011 to 2021.

# 2. The Battery Storage Boom

The rapid growth of grid-scale battery storage systems (BESS) is a game-changer for microgrids and decentralized energy. Batteries enable microgrids and home grids to operate independently for longer periods, even when renewable sources aren't available, ensuring grid resilience. In Q1 2024, U.S. energy storage capacity installations surged 84% year-over-year, hitting a record 3,851 MW.

Projections indicate significant market growth:

* **Growth Projection**: Bain projects that the grid-scale storage market could expand from around $15 billion in 2023 to between $200 billion and $700 billion by 2030, potentially reaching $1 trillion to $3 trillion by 2040.
* **Decline in Price:** The decline in lithium battery prices is driving their adoption for grid storage. The average price of stationary lithium batteries per kilowatt-hour fell by about 40% between 2019 and 2023.
* **Segmentation**: The market is segmented into three main areas: front-of-the-meter utility-scale installations, behind-the-meter commercial and industrial installations, and BTM residential installations.

These systems will turbocharge the capacity additions of wind and solar:

* **Solar and Wind:** Nearly 1 terawatt of new solar and wind capacity will be added to the U.S. power grid between 2024 and 2035.
* **Storage**: 221 gigawatts of battery storage are expected to be deployed in the same period.
* **Growth**: These additions will drive an 80% increase in the nameplate power generation capacity of the U.S. by 2035, even accounting for planned power plant retirements.

# 3. The Rise of Small, Efficient AI

As an AI Engineer, I've observed the rise of Small Language Models (SLMs). These models are equally competent when prompted and fine-tuned correctly, require significantly lower energy consumption, and are much more cost-effective. Training and running Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources and energy, which is costly and unsustainable.

For instance, training a small language model with 7 billion parameters using 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs takes about 336 hours and consumes approximately 50 MWh of energy. In contrast, a model with over 100 billion parameters requires 1024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 1344 ",ValueInvesting,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fsj2s5/building_a_position_in_decentralized_energy/

mr-anderson-one,Thoughts on ACLS? Looks undervalued to me.,1728074186,1fw95bm,0,7,"Hey guys, I calculate (conservative scenario) about 22% upside for ACLS. This company has good roic, good bvps growth, and also good eps, revenue and fcf growth (except fcf growth went down in the last two quarters). Have 43M long term debt while having 152M in FCF. Overall looks great. If I assume 15% growth for the next five years, with future pe of 15 -- I calculate value to be 122$ a share. And this is conservative, because if I look at the past growths gor these metrics it's more around 20s. So I feel like there is at lease 20% upside in this company. if it grows say 18 then we are looking at 40% upside.   
They make parts that are needed in semiconductors and EVs, but I've read that their main demand is coming from EVs. I think maybe they are not trading at their value because of EV demand currently. Do you have any thesis as to why it might not be trading at its value? Curios to hear your thoughts.

Toutsios-Toutsiou,Serge Energy investment situation - No news and seems to be a scam,1707832857,1apu5lw,0,1,"Hello everyone,

I went through all the comments around the Serge Energy situation and I must admit that I am on the same page. Unfortunately I have done a lot of research and everything seemed fine in the past, but now it seems is a scam. Feeling so stupid but here we are.

To cut the long story short: 

Even though I invested in 2022 and in 2023, I was expecting to get the first returns in November 2023 (since contracts were from 2021). On November 2023, I received the proposal for Veneer Sheets and I invested again, since I was greedy and also because I was feeling that I had no choice to proceed only with the Biomass. I was told that Veneer sheet was going to be paid on February 2024 and Biomass extraction on April/May 2024. My account manager is Patrick Murphy for the Biomass Extraction but someone with name Collin is responsible for the Veneer Sheet production. 

Close to year end of 2023, I got a message that my Veneer Sheet was scheduled and that I should provide bank details in order to send me the returns for the Veneer Sheets at the beginning of February 2024, which I provided. Yesterday and today I was trying to contact them but the emails are not delivered. I am sending emails to all the available emails on their site but no one seems to answer and also seem that are not delivered. 

I have never received any email, mentioning for any delays for the Veneer Sheet production. 

I will try to contact the Finland embassy in my country Cyprus and ask if they can help with it.

Thanks everyone for giving so many information, since until I find this group I was feeling that I was alone on this. Thank you, to the persons that provided information of the finish authorities also.

Hope we will find a solution on this.",investing,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1apu5lw/serge_energy_investment_situation_no_news_and/

I would like to invest in certain funds/ETFs that pay dividends, most of them to be qualified dividends. Before doing that, I would like to see the history of the distributions from that fund.

In Vanguard, for example, I can see the year-end QDI figures (payments in December) but not the payments made in other quarters.

One example of this is payments on 09/28/2023, 06/29/2023, and 03/24/2023 from VFIAX 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares. I cannot see any option to see the qualified dividend ratio for these dividend payments.

Eaxecx,Bitcoin - a Little Lecture on Value,1707924298,1aqpghf,0,1,"In the general population and especially among Bitcoin supporters, there's a belief that the value of an item is what the last market participant traded for it. So, if ten years ago one traded 0.001 dollars for 1 bitcoin, that was bitcoin's value. Today, people trade 50,000 dollars for one bitcoin, so this is its value. 

The first question to ask here is why is the value of bitcoin expressed in dollars? For example, if we say that two bananas are more valuable than one banana we don't need dollars or anything else to express this. This is obvious in itself - two bananas give more nutrition than one.

The above is also true for stocks or fiat currencies. A hundred shares in a company's stock give more dividends, buyback value or funds from liquidated assets than one share. A thousand dollars gives more ability to satisfy debt owed to banks than a hundred dollars. Namely, new units of fiat currencies are issued as debt owed to banks. Individuals and companies owe it to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe it to central banks based on bonds.

So if we say that the higher number of bananas, shares or dollars is worth more than their lower number, we don't express this in terms of euros, pizzas, haircuts or any other item traded on the market. Rather, we are expressing this value in term of bananas, stocks, or dollars themselves.

But now let's assume that Alice has 1 bitcoin while Bob has 100 bitcoins. How can Bob prove that his holdings have a hundred times more value? If he says this is because he can get a hundred times more dollars, pizzas or haircuts on the market, he is expressing the value of bitcoins in terms of other items traded on the market. He is essentially saying what buyers are willing to trade for bitcoins. But obviously, this tells us nothing about the bitcoins themselves.

So the crucial question to ask is this: what can 100 bitcoins give that is a hundred times more in comparison to what 1 bitcoin can give?

Is that nutrition? No, bitcoins cannot be eaten. Is that dividend, buyback value, or funds from a liquidated company? No, the issuer of bitcoin pays no dividends or buybacks nor is there a company that can be liquidated. Is that debt satisfaction? No, new Bitcoin units are not issued as debt owed to someone. Is that beauty? No, bitcoin is not art. As we can see, there's nothing that bitcoins can give. Both 100 bitcoins and 1 bitcoin are equally worthless.

So basically, what the author of Bitcoin did is create a protocol that tells people: you have 1 bitcoin, you have 5 bitcoins, you have 0.001 bitcoins, etc. But these people have nothing besides what the protocol told them. If we for example write down: 'Bob owns 10 bananas' that doesn't mean it is true. If Bob cannot show an actual fruit in the said quantity, this is just a false statement. Likewise, given that Bitcoin holders can show nothing in the quantity of numbers attributed to them by the Bitcoin protocol, their holdings are essentially false statements.

To conclude. What people confuse when they say that bitcoin has value is price and value. Bitcoin has a price because buyers pay money such as dollars when the Bitcoin protocol attributes numbers to their addresses. But Bitcoin has no value because these buyers have nothing besides these numbers. That means that buying bitcoins just means buying false numeric statements issued by the Bitcoin protocol. It's some kind of a financial scheme similar to pyramid ones. As long as there are new investors, the old ones can get their investments back. But given there's no value in the scheme, the lack of new investors means the collapse of the scheme.",investing,0.24,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aqpghf/bitcoin_a_little_lecture_on_value/

ChadPenningtonFan,Parents Getting Screwed by their advisor - Try Facet?,1708024221,1arndnn,0,4,"Parents have a portfolio worth around 4.5M. Dad is early 70s earning \~250K/year and will work another 1-8 years (he would like to work as long as he can, but taking into account uncertainty). Mom late 60s, doesn’t work. Total expenses around 100-120K/year, no one is sick yet. Risk averse people.  
They pay advisor .75% fee, with 20% in money market, 75% bonds, 5% VTSAX bringing their total expense ratio to around 1%. Comes to around 40K/year in fees (they hold some money in their own checking account). Parents not financially literate at all. I figured if they have almost all their money in cash/fixed income, but still insist on having an advisor, Facet can do that for a quoted 5-6K/year, plus expense ratio around .1%.  That would save them about $30K/year in cost, plus they can invest $500-800K into low cost index funds given there’s a high likelihood at least one lives another 15-20 years. Facet claims to have a HYSA at 5.3% right now, and they can keep a primarily-fixed income plan but save a ton of money.

Rivercitybruin,is Cramer a lagging indicator? and some other questions...,1721947237,1ec886j,0,1,"used to see him quite a bit on trading floor TV. thankfully I don't anymore.

is Cramer a lagging indicator like much of the financial press? basically they describe what has happened or what is happening rather than what may happen.

  
if oil is down 40% y/y, I would much rather have someone show me the reasons to buy than sell. the reasons to sell have been in the newspaper for the past year.

I thought he was like this but I see his R2000 vs. QQQ call which isn't lagging at all, unless you think really short-term

  
which brings me to my biggest Cramer complaint, I find his actions very short term but he talks like he's quite long-term.. he'll be onto something else the next week.

AlexanderNigma,Highest reasonable withdrawal rate for a 30 year retirement?,1722094765,1edj7ph,0,20,"I know stuff like the 4% rule and such so those are reasonably safe positions to take.

I'm considering going as high as 5% if my health declines faster than expected. Its an awkward spot where I *probably* won't get disability since its partially mental health (I've been in the higher security mental hospital ward for a month+ before with the kind of eye watering bills one might expect with that) which is hard to quantify.

That said it does affect my work performance and while one of my doctors suggests trying to apply for disability anyway I don't see a point as long as I can keep employment that keeps me from touching my savings.

But eventually, it will reach a critical point where age bias (tech) combined with just the fact my health affects job performance to the points it can't really be concealed, I just started with a high enough baseline performance I can stay employed for awhile.

The odds for stuff like firecalc is stuff like:

For our purposes, failure means the portfolio was depleted before the end of the 30 years. FIRECalc found that 41 cycles failed, for a success rate of 66.9%.

For 5%. That seems kinda rough but at the same time I believe it doesn't factor in social security so it might be a realistic goal of 5% (ignoring social security)

Just polling people's thoughts on the subject (source material for research welcome) to try to gauge how aggressive my portfolio needs to be given my doctors and I have a rough timeline of how fast things will decline because I can't keep taking the drugs that actually work given the side effects get worse the longer I take them.",investing,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1edj7ph/highest_reasonable_withdrawal_rate_for_a_30_year/

As a 19 year old just getting started with my first couple thousand dollars, I am far more attracted to quick growth than seemingly boring dividend income, though when I am older I can see dividend income being attractive as a way to replace my income at retirement.

Do these people prefer to have let's say 1 million in their accounts paying 40k in dividends rather than 2 million in their account paying 20k?

Just trying to get a grip of what people think, I am by no means bashing this view and I actually respect those who dedicate their portfolios to dividend income, I find it interesting and am trying to learn.",investing,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aizrx1/explain_to_me_why_slower_and_less_overall_growth/
f00dl3,What if this scenario plays out?,1707174844,1ajupdn,0,1,"March FOMC - no rate cuts. Market may not like this, and we have a 10% correction. 

&#x200B;

This 10% correction will set the stage for a massive economic situation to play out. The Federal Reserve will not want to abandon the inflation threat, so they are going to be aggressive at keeping interest rates high while doing nothing to control the National Debt.

&#x200B;

High interest rates will actually cause the Federal Reserve to have to increase the national debt, which in turn will cause inflation to come back over the Spring and Summer 2024 months.

&#x200B;

May FOMC - no rate cuts. Market will trade flat through the summer months. Economic situation with layoffs and job cuts will get worse. Banks will start to experience stress as they will be upside down in ""Bond gambling"" at a much faster rate than March 2023.

&#x200B;

September FOMC - Federal Reserve may have to institute emergency rate cuts, even with inflation running hot at 5% once again. This will cause a massive stock market crash, and being in September - right at the seasonal low for stock markets in general. S&P 500 could correct to 2,900 by January 2025.

&#x200B;

And the scary part - inflation may end up at 6% going into 2025 even if we have a major market crash, because the interest rate hikes do not address the cause of inflation. The government will actually likely create more inflation rescuing out big banks that may fail due to interest rate pressure, and I don't really know how this ends well.",investing,0.26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ajupdn/what_if_this_scenario_plays_out/

So…..A few weeks ago I bought in to Nvda @ 600 a share and got a pretty good roasting for doing so. The single best piece of advice I took from said roasting, is- if you are going to invest in a stock ( Nvidia) , at least take the time to research what a semiconductor is and all that surrounds it. I did just that and now have shares in Nvidia, TSM and SMH. Call me what you will but I believe I’ll see some good profits moving forward. All that said- my future allocations towards tech will go to TSM and SMH. Nvidia is going to have to either take a dip or split before I add to its individual stock. 
I do recognize the risk, overlap and lack of diversification. I also recognize the potential for big profits surrounding AI and that’s what I’m after over the next 10 yrs. 
I also note that I have plenty of safe money invested in other ETF’s, a 457, pension and rental properties.

dubov,Three consumer discretionary falling knives you can try to catch,1728074818,1fw9dxq,0,22,"I like all three of these stocks at their current prices. They are all quite volatile and yes this is knife catchy, but the turnaround will likely be quite sharp when it comes

Stellantis - The most maligned company in the most maligned sector recently. Poor sales, particularly US sales in H1. Very high inventory. Price cuts in H2 to clear out the inventory ready for 2025 models. There have also been some cuts in production, and cost cutting. Earnings likely to be poor for the next few quarters, but they will be back on track in a year or two IMO. They do have a very well diversified portfolio of brands and a good mix of market exposure. Their balance sheet is exception for an automaker. 

Dr. Martens - UK based retailer with global exposure. Distinctive bootwear which has had an almost cult like following at various points in the past. Sales have been very poor over the past 2 years. The sales drop is again worst in US market, which has seen a strong decline in bootwear sales generally, although Dr Martens have fared somewhat worse. They are predominantly a one product company which makes it more risky but also more potentially rewarding. Positive sides are very attractive margins and a still reasonably good balance sheet. 

Burberry - UK luxury company. Again, suffering sharp drops in sales. This one is at a slightly earlier stage than the other two. Currently, there are no significant corrective actions in place, management argue they aren't needed and they probably won't be if we see a rebound in luxury. Decent amount of China exposure if interested. Excellent margins as you would expect. Balance sheet fine. Of the three, this is one I am least confident of, I can imagine things may get worse before they get better.

xcrowsx,Medpace (MEDP): My quick overview,1728390270,1fyyhys,0,8,"**My Investment Thesis:**

MEDP is a well-established contract research organization (CRO) that focuses on late-stage drug development, primarily serving small and midsize biotech firms. The company’s deep expertise in managing complex, multinational trials and its high customer switching costs create a substantial economic moat. Medpace’s global regulatory knowledge and ability to shorten clinical trial times give it a significant advantage, supporting long-term client relationships.

Financially, Medpace shows strong growth and has a $2.9 billion backlog. The company has a healthy balance sheet, low debt, and focuses on organic growth. However, recent project cancellations and the need to stay innovative present challenges. With a fair price estimate of $394.83, Medpace appears undervalued by about 13%, offering upside potential for long-term investors. At least, a very good choice for a watchlist and regular checks.

**Company Overview:**

» A contract research organization (CRO)   
» Focuses on late-stage drug development   
» Offers full clinical trial services to small and midsize biotech, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies   
» Provides extra services, like bioanalytical lab work and imaging capabilities   
» Started over 30 years ago and now has more than 5,800 employees in 40 countries   
» Mainly operates in the U.S., but it also has locations in Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, and Australia

**CEO:**

August J. Troendle (68), M.D. has been the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Medpace since he founded the company in July 1992.

**Strengths:**

» Healthy backlog of $2.8 billion   
» Deep expertise   
» Dedicated project teams

**Risks:**

» Increased project cancellations   
» Must continually invest   
» Product governance risks

dubov,G13 - Genting Singapore,1728679177,1g1jjb5,0,9,"This is an interesting business IMO.

They own 'Resort World Sentosa', an integrated resort on a small island in Singapore. It is one of only two sites in Singapore where gambling is legal. 

Aside from the casino, they have a Universal Studios theme park, oceanarium, water park, 4 hotels, villas, and many restaurants.

Revenues went off a cliff during covid, but they impressively managed to avoid losses. They are now close to 2019 profitability, and the outlook is good, with further expected increases in the number of foreign visitors. The outlook would be further improved by a China rebound.

The profit margins are very high, and they have a moat with their casino business. 

Trades at 15x earnings, with EV/EBITDA around 6, although this is low partly because they have a Japanese-style cash pile. Despite that, they do have a high payout ratio, typically 70% or better, with the current dividend yield around 4.6%.

This raises the question: is this dividend sustainable in the long run?



While Pepsi has shown consistent profit margins around 10% and decent returns on invested capital, the revenue growth has been relatively flat, hovering in the low single digits. The video also highlighted that even though Pepsi is a well-known brand, its growth potential seems limited compared to competitors like Monster Beverage.

dubov,"Analysts reactions' to China Stimulus measures announced earlier today - ""Underwhelming, but they are pointing in the right direction now""",1728727162,1g1wt7u,0,15,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) -China said on Saturday it will ""significantly increase"" government debt issuance to offer subsidies to people with low incomes, support the property market and replenish state banks' capital as it pushes to revive sputtering economic growth.

Without providing details on the size of the fiscal stimulus being prepared, Finance Minister Lan Foan told a news conference there will be more ""counter-cyclical measures"" this year.

Global financial markets have been keenly awaiting more details on China's stimulus plans, fearing its 2024 economic growth target and longer-term growth trajectory may be at risk if more support is not announced soon.

Here are some comments from investors and analysts on the press briefing from China's finance ministry:

RONG REN GOH, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, EASTSPRING INVESTMENTS, SINGAPORE

""Investors were hoping for fresh stimulus, accompanied by specific numbers, to be announced at the MOF presser, including the size of these commitments. From this perspective, it turned out to be somewhat of a damp squib given only vague guidance was provided.

""That said, there were meaningful measures announced. The MoF affirmed room for the central government to increase debt, more support for housing markets, and increased local government debt quotas to alleviate refinancing woes.

""However, with markets focused on 'how much' over 'what', they were invariably set up to be disappointed by this briefing.""

HUANG XUEFENG, CREDIT RESEARCH DIRECTOR, SHANGHAI ANFANG PRIVATE FUND CO, SHANGHAI

""The focus seems to be around funding the fiscal gap and solving local government debt risks, which far undershoots expectations that had been priced into the recent stock market jump. Without arrangements targeting demand and investment, it's hard to ease the deflationary pressure.""

ZHAOPENG XING, SENIOR CHINA STRATEGIST, ANZ, SHANGHAI

""MOF focused more on derisking local governments. It will likely add new quotas of treasury and local bonds. We expect a 10 trillion yuan ($1.42 trillion) implicit debt swap in the next few years. Official deficit and local bond quotas may both increase to 5 trillion yuan going forward.  But it looks (to be) not much this year. We expect 1 trillion ultra-long treasury and 1 trillion local bonds to be announced by NPC this month end.""

BRUCE PANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST CHINA, JONES LANG LASALLE, HONG KONG

""The message released from today's press conference is actually quite in line with the expectations of those familiar with China's policy-making process and state structure. The officials have given answers to questions of 'how' but no details of 'when', yet.

""I will expect more details and number of the previewed fiscal stimulus to be published only after the upcoming meeting of the NPCSC to approve a plan to increase treasury issuance and provide a mid-year revision to the national budget. And it would be reasonable and practical to keep room for policy manoeuvring to prepare for external shocks and uncertainties.""

CHRISTOPHER WONG, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, OCBC, SINGAPORE

""There was mention of 2.3 trillion yuan and some details on local bond issuance that can support housing ... but it stopped short of a big surprise factor. That said, we shouldn't lose sight of the bigger picture and that is policymakers acknowledged the issues and are putting in genuine effort to tackle those issues.

""More time may be needed for more thought-out and targeted measures. But those measures also need to come fast as markets are eagerly waiting for them. Over expectations vs under-delivery would result in disappointment and that can manifest itself into Chinese markets.""

TIANCHEN XU, SENIOR ECONOMIST, ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT, BEIJING

""Our overall take is quite positive in that MoF is willing to tackle China’s many economic challenges by leveraging its borrowing room. The immediate benefits to the economy will be limited, as the MoF avoided large-scale direct cash handouts to households.

diss_a_vowel,ROCE to Cash Accumulation in Pulak Prasad's book,1727699577,1fsue7e,0,1,"In “What I Learned About Investing from Darwin”, Pulak Prasad says

*Company X growing its sales at 10 percent with ROCE of 25 percent can grow from zero cash to a cash balance of almost 18 percent of sales in five years (other assumptions: margin 15 percent, tax 30 percent). With an increasing cash cushion, X’s management team can choose to launch new products or target new geography. Even if the new business fails, X can recover given its ability to generate cash from its core business. Now let’s look at its competitor, Y, which is growing at the same rate (10 percent) with the same margin (15 percent) but with a lower ROCE of 12 percent. In five years, Y would have a negative cash balance of 3 percent of revenue. In other words, Y would have to borrow to grow at the same rate as X.*

His point is that all else being equal, a high ROCE business will generate more cash than a low ROCE business. And rough math holds up the argument.

But I can't seem to get close to his numbers. I'd appreciate any help in understanding the arithmetic.  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For company X, the book says ""*almost 18 percent*"". My number is higher at 21%.

For company Y, my number of -3.6% is closer to the what the book says.

I have made the following assumptions:

* ROCE = EBIT / Capital employed
* Free cash not added to capital employed (Says so in the book)
* No debt and so no interest payment
* ""Margin"" means operating margin, i.e. EBIT = Revenue X Margin
* Ignored all other complications and kept it simple.

I have 10 data points to determine the probability distribution for my Monte Carlo simulation of the business value of a company. I have 2 choices. 

* First is to find the best fit curve and then use this to generate the simulated value for the parameter. 
* Second is just to use a triangular distribution since there is only 10 data points. 

Some thoughts on the choices from Chat GPT

a) Fitting a distribution can provide a more nuanced understanding of your data, but with only 10 points, it may not yield reliable results.

b) A triangular distribution is straightforward to implement and requires only three parameters: minimum, mode, and maximum. This can make it a good choice when data is limited.

Which would you use?

Both organizations caught my interest with their focus on investment management and Bitcoin mining services, respectively. Rollman Capital promotes a conviction-driven investment approach, aiming to blend performance with a positive societal impact. Meanwhile, Rollman Mining is all about providing access to Bitcoin mining through procurement of miners, software, pools, and hosting services, emphasizing professional-level equipment for both private and professional clients.  
  
My curiosity led me to a video call with the CEO of Rollman Mining, where we discussed various aspects of their services, including costs, potential ROI, and the specifics of their Bitcoin mining operations. While the conversation was enlightening, offering deep insights into their business model and promises of transparency and high returns, I'm left wanting to cross-reference these claims with independent experiences.  
  
Given the scarcity of independent reviews and a lack of publicly available financial data or significant third-party media coverage, I'm reaching out to this knowledgeable community for any personal experiences or insights you might have about Rollman Capital or Rollman Mining. I'm particularly interested in:  
  
**-Anyone who has engaged with Rollman Capital or Rollman Mining, especially regarding investment outcomes.**

  
**-Feedback on their operational transparency, customer service, and any red flags you might have noticed.**

  
**-Your method of due diligence when assessing firms with limited third-party validation.**

  
**-Specific insights regarding the costs, ROI, and overall experience if you've had a direct conversation or engagement with their executives, similar to my video call with their CEO.**

  
Your advice, experiences, or any recommendations would be invaluable to me and, I'm sure, to others considering these companies.

cazort2,"No load, no fee money-market Mutual Funds with minimums > $1 but less than $1M?",1708026344,1aro8ij,0,1,"I currently put some cash in the mutual fund SNOXX, short-term, because it gets over 5% interest. It has a $1 minimum investment which is super convenient for using for ""loose ends"" in a brokerage account. It yields a heck of a lot more than most cash sweeps, and is only slightly less flexible because I can get the money out of it by the end of the day and then trade with it a couple days later at the latest. Unlike savings accounts there is no transaction limit per month so it's perfect for temporary money storage, and rebalancing purposes in a portfolio.

I notice that there are also funds that are similar, but have minimum balances of $1M, which, understandably, yield a bit more (often as much as 0.25% more), probably because of lower expense ratios because they have fewer little transactions. I have nowhere near this level of cash.

However, I would love to find something intermediate between it and these higher-yield, higher-minimum-balance ones. I don't particularly need the full flexibility of the $1 minimum balance nor do I really need to be able to trade in $1 increments.

Like if I'm buying / selling in increments of $100, $1,000, or $10,000, but am nowhere near the $1M mark, is there any way to squeeze another 0.05% or 0.1% or so return, out of some similar mutual fund that has the same basic flexibility? Or are there ones where if I keep a minimum of say $10-20k, I could trade it in any increment?

-Diversification
-Greater Tax Efficiency

Plus, looking over them to ensure I am still in agreement with what I aiming for is stressful at times. I still want to continue being exposed to an aggressive investment but would you recommend the following for a 3-fund portfolio? I did some research and I saw that these funds are the best. My allocations may need some changing but I am in it for 30+ years and I want to be smart(er) about my investments.

PlungeLikeLivermore,Big Returns With Verifiable Track Record But Need Advice,1722102371,1edm3f4,0,1,"Hi all, I posted this on another sub as well but hoping, given the larger audience here, there's someone that might have some advice.

I'm middle-aged and have been an avid trader for a very long time. I've always wanted to manage money but within the last 5-years my career has put me in a position that I feel has helped me mature to the point where I can be consistently successful.

Recognizing I was ""ready"" I decided to start formalizing a track record a bit more than a year ago. I opened a corporate account with IBKR and funded it with $140k of my own capital.

My returns have been extremely strong, yet volatile. In 2023 I returned 157% (July through December) and this year I'm currently at about a 40% return. My strategy is discretionary, repeatable, and scales.

I also have a lot of relationships with investors, but they are in the real estate world. I put together my tear sheet and short marketing deck and have started circulating it to some folks I'm closer with to gain feedback (and potentially soft commitments).

I've also had a couple conversations with the folks at Repool about fund setup and administration.

Here's where I'm struggling... fundraising!

Yes, it's early and I've only just started talking with folks but the reception has not been strong. Mostly, I believe I'm talking with the wrong folks. These are real estate people that generally don't trust the stock market. They are also smaller mom and pop type investors.

I know I will need at least $2MM - $3MM in commitments to justify spinning up the fund and I'm recognizing it will likely be a GRIND getting there.

So I'm asking myself whether it makes sense to pursue that route or, perhaps, go the non-professional advisor route with IBKR. The logic here would be that I could take my time onboarding people individually. Then, once we get too big for that, or the fund size justifies it, I could transition to a full-fledged fund.

The other route is just grinding soft commitments to get me to the $2MM - $3MM point and hoping most are still wanting to commit when it comes time.

Any thoughts or advice from folks that have been there and done this would be much appreciated.

Thank you!",investing,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1edm3f4/big_returns_with_verifiable_track_record_but_need/

Oimetra09,What am I missing on this scenario?,1722267426,1ef2n1m,0,1,"Note: I tried using the search, and did find some people asking about 0% APR cards, which I guess is a bit of a similar thing, but given the limited time 0% APR lasts, compounding interests wouldn't really matter, also most answers telling them their math makes no sense is based on them having to find a way to spend/save the amount quickly enough for it to matter or that cash advances usually carry other/daily interests, which is not the case I'm presenting.

I was looking at my CC statement today, and I got curious about a detail I usually pay no attention to the ""minimum payment calculation"", usually I just pay the balance in full, but I guess I was kinda bored and tried to run some numbers.

Statement claims:

* Current balance: 7,120.88
* Minimum payment: 200.00
* APR: 21.24%

Then it says: If you make no additional transactions using this Account and each month you pay only the Minimum Payment. You will pay off the balance shown on this statement in about 21 Years. And you will end up paying an estimated total of $18,308.00

Let's say I take this 7,120.88 which I already have, and instead of paying my CC like I normally do, I put it on a 10% return investment for the same 21 years, compound interest would turn this into 52,696.29

Even if I consider that the current 10% is probably not going to stay for the entire 21 years, and use 5% which is more in line with the historic returns of this investment, after 21 years of compound interest I would have 19,838.51

This makes no sense to me, how can it be better for me not to pay my current debt? I see no reason not to just stick to paying the minimum payment until I max out the CC and then keep paying only the minimum forever (as long as both rates do not dramatically change, and in case they do I can liquidate the investment to liquidate the debt).

Would probably suck for my credit score, but I honestly could have a credit score of 0 and I wouldn't care (I have my own reasons for this)",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ef2n1m/what_am_i_missing_on_this_scenario/

Old Company:

  
• XYZ provides a 60% matching contribution of your pretax contributions, up to the first 20% of your contributions per pay

Vesting is 100% after 6 years

&#x200B;

New Company:

When you make contributions to the 401(k) plan, you are eligible to receive a company match of 100% ($1 for $1) up to the first 6% of your eligible pay.

Vesting is 100% immediately.

&#x200B;

Given a salary of $240,000...  New company will match a max of $553 per paycheck (we're paid every two weeks)?  

I'm contributing 10% of my salary towards my 401(k) right now, which coincidentally gives me the same company match as the new company.  But... if I were to increase that even by 1%, the old company would increase its match.

&#x200B;

Yeah, I get to the max contribution with less personal investment with this new company, but the old company has the potential to match up to $28,800/yr (yes, I know that's above the limit) whereas the new company can only match up to half that.

f00dl3,Is Life Insurance a waste of money if you're debt free?,1706981608,1ai1euf,0,1,"Here's the situation - I have a $150 annual premium $25k death benefit $3.5k cash value life insurance policy (as of now.) It's generating about $72 of dividend income per my latest 1099-DIV that I received from it. 

&#x200B;

We have no mortgage, no car loans, we're DINKs, and only just opened a outstanding loan for replacing some of our windows and french doors in the house. 38 years old, wife is 39.

&#x200B;

I'm questioning right now if having this insurance does anything at all - as honestly when I pass away my 401K has a lot more money than this life insurance policy will pay out. My employer offers a $1m term policy they pay for, but at this point with no debts excluding that new loan, and enough cash to pay that off tomorrow if I wanted, I don't see any real benefit my wife or I would receive from any life insurance that I would have to pay for - and I'm really really thinking of just cashing this whole life policy out and putting the cash value into my Roth IRA. 

&#x200B;

I can see how someone with a huge load of debt would want enough life insurance to cover paying those loans off when they die so their family is not stuck with the loans - but when you are on the other end of that bridge debt free, I just don't see any benefit at all to life insurance if you have cash that will be passed along to beneficiaries.

WilliamBlack97AI,Research and detailed analysis on High Tide inc ( $HITI : Nasdaq) ,1728731774,1g1xvwi,0,1,"**Background** - How [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) became the leading cannabis retailer in Canada

**The beginning**:

Raj Grover, the founder and CEO who owns \~9% of the company and has never sold a single share (not even when it was trading 5x higher than it is today), comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click). During a business trip to India in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry, Raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. Recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity, he shipped $10,000 worth of consumption accessories from New Delhi to Canada and sold everything overnight. After replicating this success a few more times, Raj decided to open a store. **This marked the beginning of High Tide's story**.

In 2009, Raj opened Smokers’ Corner with an initial investment of less than $50,000 and grew it into a multimillion-dollar empire. At that time, there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. Raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location, he could easily capture market share, and he was right. By leveraging his established roots in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and India, he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products.

**Cannabis legalization in Canada**:

Always looking to stay ahead, Raj seized the opportunity when the Prime Minister of Canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. With an existing customer base of cannabis users, it made perfect sense for Raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. He realized that if he only sold accessories, he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories.

After nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10M in retained earnings, Raj raised $88.5M for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets, marking **the beginning of High Tide's journey as a publicly traded company**. With easier access to capital when compared to its peers, High Tide expanded its footprint across Canada, highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor Meta in 2020, which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67.

**The strategy shift that made everything change**:

Around the same time, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) began acquiring e-commerce businesses selling accessories and CBD-related products (mostly oils) with higher margin profiles, **a pivotal decision for the company**. From acquiring several brands in the U.S., such as Smoke Cartel, FABCBD, Daily High Club, DankStop, and NuLeaf Holdings, to later acquiring BlessedCBD in the UK, High Tide leveraged its market power to **enhance margins** and diversify its revenue streams.

In the summer of 2021, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) was accepted for listing on the Nasdaq, marking a significant milestone.

Later that year, a transformative decision was made: **High Tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in October 2021**. With consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned CBD-related acquisitions, High Tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices, **attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share**.



Although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss, **the move proved to be incredibly successful**. High Tide's market share increased from less than 4% to over 10% in less than three years, despite representing less than 5% of the total cannabis retail store count. **Today, the discount model program has more than 1.5M members and continues to grow each quarter**.

Being the first-of-its-kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled High Tide to become the ",ValueInvesting,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1g1xvwi/research_and_detailed_analysis_on_high_tide_inc/

Hunkachunk,"quality, value oriented writer pushing my own stuff",1728742189,1g20xoc,0,37,"Hey guys!

I am a 31 year old guy from Norway, who earlier this year started writing about my investment process through a newsletter.

I actually learned and got started investing through Reddit and this platform propelled my curiosity forward.

I have written around 15 articles so far. They range from me reflecting on stuff I learn, and how we can take advantage of research and factors to become better investors to business rundowns on individual companies.

My portfolio consists of the following companies:
1. SanLorenzo
2. O'Reilly Automotive
3. Evolution AB
4. Constellation Software
5. Visa 
6. Kinsale Capital Group
7. Hermes
8. Norbit ASA
9. Paradox Interactive
10. Topicus
11. AQ Group
12. NCAB Group

As you can see, I have a twofold strategy: Own large, great companies growing predictably over time and smaller nordic/European companies with good growth and which the market underestimates.

I define myself as a quality growth investor, meaning that I seek companies that have long lasting competitive advantages and long runways for growth. 

I would love to discuss with more people, and get feedback from anyone on my processes and investments. The Substack is called Learning to Grow, and it's all about me reflecting on and sharing stuff I learn as I read about investments and research companies. I try to present original and lesser known opportunities. My goal is for my writing to be an open journal of investments, where I can become a better investor through my writings.

I of course think all the stuff I write is of quality, but I want to highlight three pieces I'm particularly happy with:

1. My deep dives into two individual companies: [Paradox Interactive](https://growthbylearning.substack.com/p/paradox-interactive-a-gem-in-the) and [Norbit](https://growthbylearning.substack.com/p/norbit-a-profitable-problem-solver)

diss_a_vowel,Cashflow & ROCE calc from Pulak Prasad's investing book,1727709041,1fsxvfq,0,4,"In “What I Learned About Investing from Darwin”, Pulak Prasad says

*Company X growing its sales at 10 percent with ROCE of 25 percent can grow from zero cash to a cash balance of almost 18 percent of sales in five years (other assumptions: margin 15 percent, tax 30 percent). With an increasing cash cushion, X’s management team can choose to launch new products or target new geography. Even if the new business fails, X can recover given its ability to generate cash from its core business. Now let’s look at its competitor, Y, which is growing at the same rate (10 percent) with the same margin (15 percent) but with a lower ROCE of 12 percent. In five years, Y would have a negative cash balance of 3 percent of revenue. In other words, Y would have to borrow to grow at the same rate as X.*

His point is that all else being equal, a high ROCE business will generate more cash than a low ROCE business. And rough math holds up the argument.

But I can't seem to get close to his numbers. I'd appreciate any help in understanding the arithmetic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For company X, the book says ""*almost 18 percent*"". My number is higher at 21%.

For company Y, my number of -3.6% is closer to the what the book says.

I have made the following assumptions:

* ROCE = EBIT / Capital employed
* Free cash not added to capital employed (Says so in the book)
* No debt and so no interest payment
* ""Margin"" means operating margin, i.e. EBIT = Revenue X Margin
* Ignored all other complications and kept it simple.

VectorSpaceModel,Spirit Airlines- It's always darkest before pitch black,1728112092,1fwkpp0,0,13,"I'm going through the latest 10K for Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) as there are rumors of bankruptcy proceedings. Really, what an obvious death spiral. Clearly, they were losing a game of catch up with debt while hopelessly trying to improve their operating margins.

If one looks at the cash flows going back to 2022, one can see that they are issuing more and more debt while trying to service existing debt. They're even paying premiums to get out of certain debts early. All with -$500 million in operating losses annually. Notably, they pay off 1.5 billion in debt over 3 years, only to issue $1.7 billion more in debt and $375 million stock in the same period. They even pay $600 million to exit some debts early.

  
As low as their market cap is and as cheap as their bonds might be, it does me no good to be a shareholder of a cash burning machine that cannot easily be acquired (see JetBlue's failed acquisition of Spirit) or a bondholder of a company that will have a hard time liquidating and a harder time servicing the debt.

The balance sheet is a mess because they had to take on a lot of debt around Covid, but they have already started clearing that down and it is on a nice trend. If they were to regain 2019 profitability, their PE would be around 11.

They may also have a moat. Gambling is illegal in China, aside from a state run lottery. The Chinese government wants people to go to Macau if they want to gamble. There is competition within Macau, but licensing is strictly controlled and there are only a few players in the game.

However, there is a massive black market for gambling. Per China's own estimates, it probably draws twice the revenue of their state run lotteries. Chinese users can connect to a VPN and bet with shady companies in Philippines, Cambodia etc. Proxy betting, via a phone, is also a popular option for high net worth clients.

I do wonder if the government will cave at some point and legalise online gambling to collect that sweet revenue. That would be, on the face of it, bad for Melco, but, it is also possible that they would have an advantage in gaining licences for online services, and therefore in fact, it would open up a massive new market for them. Maybe I'm being too optimistic?

beezer9717,ALTO and Ethanol Stocks are severely undervalued,1728405185,1fz43xz,0,9,"The market seems to be missing the fundamentals in the ethanol sector.  Corn prices were elevated with the start of the Russia/Ukraine war, but have since come down significantly leading to ethanol crush margins to expand.  For the quarter ended September 30th, Crush margins were extremely elevated and this will start flowing to the balance sheets in earnings. 

ALTO Ingredients trades at less than half tangible book value, and if you look recently that $GEVO purchased an ethanol plant for $210 million dollars and that plant had 65 million gallons of annual capacity.  ALTO has 350 million gallons of annual capacity and it affirms that the assets are undervalued and the market is missing this.   ALTO has about $100 million in debt and the current market cap of $123 million so the potential for value unlock is there in assets alone  

Operationally high crush margins will flow to the balance sheet and crush margins have eased the last month, they still remain higher than than the historical norm for this time of year.  US Ethanol demand is expanding as more fueling stations roll out E15/Unleaded 88 gasoline which is a 15% ethanol blend compared to the typical 10% blend, as these roll out it creates more demand, however US Ethanol exports have seen a big surge upwards as other countries are blending more ethanol into their gasoline, as Europe increases their blends and Japan is poised to increase blending from 3% to 10%, along with other nations, Vietnam, China and others studying higher blending, the export markets look to only increase.  

The other big benefit that is going to drive ethanol demand is ethanol is a good feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel, it takes about 1.7 gallons of ethanol to produce 1 gallon of SAF, and the SAF market is growing rapidly in the United States and other nations, plus the added benefit is tax credits for using SAF which will drive demand and the potential for tax credit benefits for ethanol producers to flow to the bottom line, along with Carbon Capture and Storage which ALTO and others have been investing in.   

ALTO seems poised to rally due to being near the lows, based on assets and also a strong and robust ethanol market that currently seem out of favor with Wall Street.  ",ValueInvesting,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fz43xz/alto_and_ethanol_stocks_are_severely_undervalued/

PaySubstantial5134,"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?",1707834511,1apur6l,0,1,"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.

Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.  


It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.  


Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.   


And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?",investing,0.37,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1apur6l/looking_at_historical_data_does_it_show_that_this/

tiskerTasker89,CZR - Caesars Entertainment 'Research',1708030378,1arpw2b,0,1,"Was in Las Vegas February 7-13, 2024. Stayed at the Horseshoe (CZR strip property). I have a traditional ""lads' trip to Vegas Super Bowl weekend every year (this was my 6th trip) - extended a bit more this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs ""mid-market' properties

Noticed that the high-end properties (Cosmo, Aria) were hopping and jammed. (note: not CZRs properties). 6-8 craps tables operating Thursday and Friday night, with $50-$100 minimums. By contrast, the CZR properties across the street (Planet Hollywood (PH), Paris, Horseshoe, Linq, Flamingo) were much quieter. For instance, PH only had 3 $15 craps tables on Thursday night.

Tables seemed no busier than previous years at the mid-market CZRs properties. Hypothesis is that the ""gambling / partying"" crowd was priced out this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs Execution Risk

PH's marquee 'Heart Bar' was being renovated and converted to a chandelier / glass bar. The new bar was not ready Wednesday-Thursday-Friday during the day of Super Bowl week. (It eventually opened Friday at midnight). Not a good look to have a marquee drinking/party hangout not ready to go for one of the busiest times of the year.

Craps dealers at Paris (Friday night) and Horseshoe (Sunday night) were a long way from being centre-strip Vegas quality. Odds are ""meh"" and limits are high - there is really no reason to make a gambling trip to Vegas - your local casino likely has better dealers, lower limits, and better odds.

CZRs restaurants

Restaurants (Nobu at Paris, Bugsy/Meyers at Flamingo) were busy and an excellent value. So were the cocktails at Vanderpump (Paris).

Conclusion

Overall, the crew this year was a bit frustrated with the CZRs experience and may look elsewhere for our next strip.

lolyonnaise,selling shares of a stock then buying them immediately again,1721848224,1eb9s54,0,1,"hello

if you're investing for the long term (years), people say not to sell shares of a stock just because the stock decreases in value.

but what if you sell shares of a stock at a loss, and then buy them immediately (at or around the same price)? Would there be any difference compared to if you did nothing?

it seems one difference might be taxes - since losses affect taxes, to ultimately make more profit, does it make sense to sell stocks at a loss, then buy them again?

I started off by just buying 5K worth of Microsoft when it was 174$. Now that I’ve made a big profit on that, I’m wondering if it’d be smart to sell some of it off, to reinvest. I’ve only sold a few stocks I’ve bought over the years, so I guess I’m more an investor than trader, but recently have been getting a little more aggressive with it and buying more volatile stuff with more chance to move faster. (CTXR and KULR have been good to me) I’m wondering if it’d make sense to sell off 5K worth, to cover my initial investment and guarantee I won’t ever lose money(not that I’m worried about Microsoft heading back to $174) or to hold, so it’s easier for my initial investment to grow",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eba5jl/selling_off_some_profit_not_sure/

MightyChain,AI Trading Tools: A Boon for the Market or a Threat to Fairness?,1722284301,1ef9o6c,0,2,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been exploring some new trading tools lately, and one that’s been getting a lot of attention on tiktok and for good reason is trademind.ca—essentially ""ChatGPT for stocks."" It’s got me thinking about a potentially explosive issue: Are AI trading tools enhancing the market, or are they fundamentally skewing it?

Here’s the issue: With AI tools like TradeMind, some traders are getting access to high-level analytics and predictive capabilities that were once out of reach. While this can be incredibly empowering, it also raises questions about fairness. Are we creating a trading landscape where those who can afford or choose to use these advanced tools have an unfair advantage over everyone else?

The controversy really heats up when you consider this: Is the proliferation of AI tools contributing to a more competitive and efficient market, or is it driving a wedge between the ""tech elite"" and the average trader? Could these tools be consolidating power in the hands of a few, making it nearly impossible for those without access to compete on an equal footing?

Some argue that AI tools are just the latest evolution in trading, giving savvy users a competitive edge that’s no different from traditional advantages like insider knowledge or high-speed trading platforms. Others worry that we’re heading toward a scenario where only those with the latest tech can thrive, while the rest of us are left scrambling for scraps.

What do you think? Are AI trading tools a step forward in making markets smarter and more efficient, or are they a threat to fair competition?

I charge based on AUM, but very little of what I do is related to investment management. I run my practice like a family office with the following services on an unlimited basis:
1. Investment management (largely passive, sophisticated hands on management including tax loss harvesting, building out individual bond ladders, providing access to alternative investment opportunities like late stage venture capital, real estate, and private equity). 
2. Cash flow planning - helping clients envision how much money they’d need to make a significant purchase (new home, relocation, etc), or to retire. 
3. Legal/estate planning - I not only provide initial suggestions for estate planning, I refer my clients to an attorney specifically selected from my network and I also sit in on every call they have with the attorney throughout the estate planning process. I act as the coordinator for every project and am with clients each step of the way. 
4. Tax advisory- my firm provides in house tax advice, and I have connections with CPAs, corporate tax planners, and tax attorneys. If a client is in need of any of these professionals, I also sit in on each of these calls to ensure I can manage a clients project properly.
5. Balance sheet management - I only get paid for my AUM, but I also advise on items that I can’t manage. I will provide input outside investment opportunities clients get from their personal networks or other investment institutions. I discuss writing individual checks to startup companies, and participate in conversations about cryptocurrency investments. 

I feel like I do a lot for my AUM fee, which starts at 0.65% and declines to 0.4% at $10M. However, it doesn’t seem like the world thinks very highly of what I do for a living.

Once interest rate cuts begin, the small caps that make up about 15% of VTI will start to perform well versus the stagnation they faced over the last few years due to lower borrowing costs, better risk appetite, etc.

**Returns over the last 5 years: VOO = 82% | VTI = 75.5%.**

Now, would it be better to switch to a more “traditional” account, say Fidelity (which handles my 401k, so I’ve had it in mind), or keep using Robinhood and invest the $8,000 in there, and transfer my current portfolio?

AssistantStraight983,Why is Julius Baer investment firm so scandalous? Is this a safe company anyway?,1707300615,1akzotn,0,46,"In addition to a long tail of scandals, CEO death, WikiLeaks, money laundering, and US Federal Investigation against Julius Baer Group, one more scandal appeared.   
In October 2023, the Financial Times exposed fraud at  Julius Baer. Gregory and Vera Mirlas, who trusted Julius Baer with their money through a wealth advisor, discovered in 2019 that their funds had been majorly misused since 2009. This was revealed during a meeting with a Goldman Sachs banker at Julius Baer, where they noticed big differences in their account numbers. Their ex-advisor at Julius Baer, Benjamin G., got a three-year jail sentence for embezzlement in 2023.

|Average Maturity|7.9 years|8.8 years|
|Average Duration|6.2 years|6.8 years|
|Average Quality|AA+|AA-|
|TER|0.07%|0.10%|

I thought the higher YTM and (presumably) lower default risk mean that VUTA will have a higher expected return, but [Vanguard's own 10-year forecast](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/vemo-return-forecasts.html) predicts a better return from global bonds instead:

|Median volatility|5.6%|4.4%|5.9%|

Where can the \~1% excess return possibly come from? And when combined with stock funds in a portfolio, should I pick VUTA based on the higher effective YTM and a lower market correlation, or VAGU due to a higher predicted return despite the lower effective YTM? Thanks for your help.

War in the Middle East will also promote less reliance on oil and gas long term.  Yeah there’s a lot of shit clean energy companies but with a balanced etf I think it’s hard to go wrong.  Most etf’s are down over 50% from 2021 highs (such as iqqh).  

A presidents influence will also make minimal difference however both candidates are strong believers in clean energy. 

Energy demand is rising rapidly - 50% of data centres energy is now required to come from renewables.

Traditional-Jump6145,UPS's glory days behind it?,1728420580,1fza8ku,0,9,"I recently watched a video discussing UPS's current financial health, and it raised some interesting points about the company's performance. With a market cap of $110 billion and an enterprise value of $156 billion, UPS is a major player in the shipping industry. However, the video highlighted a concerning trend: the company's profit margins have been declining, with a five-year profit margin of 8% [dropping to just under 6%](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/UPS/financials/metrics) in the trailing twelve months.



The speaker also pointed out that while UPS has substantial debt, this is not unusual for a capital-intensive business like shipping. They noted that the free cash flow has been consistent but is shrinking, which could be a red flag for potential investors. 



Given the recent revenue trends, which show a tapering off after a spike during the pandemic, it raises the question: Are we seeing a return to ""normal"" shipping levels, or is there a more significant shift happening in consumer behavior?

ithinkwegotelves,Why Not 100% Equities - AQR,1707837254,1apvrs0,0,17,"New post from Cliff Asness (link at the bottom). Read the whole thing, but here are a few shortened takeaways.

* I don’t know anyone who thinks a portfolio of stocks and bonds has a higher unconditional expected return than 100% stocks. We prefer a diversified portfolio because we believe it has a higher return for the risk taken, not a higher expected return.

* In general we should separate the choice of 1) what is the best return-for-risk portfolio?, and 2) what risk we should take? This new paper, and many like it, confuse the two. If the best return-for-risk portfolio doesn’t have enough expected return for you, then you lever it (within reason). If it has too much risk for you, you de-lever it with cash.

* Rising valuations (since the 1990s) have made equities themselves (and especially the USA vs. ex-USA differential) a very likely overestimation of the future.

* Simply looking at historical results and urging investors to “buy the thing that’s gone up the most over the long term” is not financial analysis, it is finger painting.

tl;dr For the love of god, stop just saying ""buy VT and chill""

> The bulk of the money that universities drew down from their endowments last year was spent on financial aid. Schools used nearly 48% of their **distributions,** on average, for that purpose, according to the report. 

Emphasis added. The whole point of the article is these top universities spend very little. 48% of the single digit % they spent. They’re acting like retirees. And that they’re spending 4% or something.

> Private foundations are required to spend at least 5% of their assets on charitable functions each year. Universities had an average endowment-spending rate of 4.7% last year, according to the survey. At universities with endowments over $1 billion, the average rate was 4.5%

> on average, schools use their endowments to pay for 11% of their annual operating budgets, the study found. Schools with larger endowments said they funded 17% or more of their budgets.

> between fiscal years 1988 and 2023, the share of endowment assets allocated to alternative investments, like private equity and venture capital, went from less than 10% to more than 50%

Beta_Nerdy,My wife's 401K rollover- with Empower- is lost in bureaucracy!,1708172539,1at0rcx,0,257,"My wife had almost $300,000 in her Empower 401K.  When she lost her job she decided to roll over the funds in her 401K into an individual IRA.  (She could have kept the money in her 401K but had lots of fees and limited investment options.)

She looked into moving the money over to Fidelity where she had an investment account, but got nervous when they told her they (Empower) would mail her a check which she would then have to present to Fidelity. The Internet is full of horror stories of 401K Rollover checks being lost or stolen from the mail.  This happened to two different friends of ours and it took them nearly a month to get it all settled and the money was out of the stock market during a month the market was booming.

So my wife decided to keep the money with Empower and open an Empower IRA so she would simply do a direct 401K to IRA Rollover within the same company.  It was suppose to be easy with no paper check. 

So two weeks ago the money was taken out of her 401K account and it now shows zero.  Every day she checks the Empower IRA Account and that shows a ZERO Balance.  The money is lost in computer bureaucracy and not getting any investment returns. The Empower Website says this should only take 2-3 business days!

Every three days she calls the Customer Service Number of Empower and after sitting on hold for 30-60 minutes an unhelpful person answers the phone and tells my wife the transfer (401K to Rollover IRA) **is in process.**

This could happen with any company doing a direct no check 401K to IRA Rollover.

WhiteX6PandaMofo,All in on $GRW and $SUPP ETFs?,1721981238,1eciojw,0,1,"I'm deep-diving into niche investment strategies and am particularly keen on sectors with robust cash flow metrics and significant growth trajectories.

Given the shifts due to deglobalization and the evolving dynamics in global supply chains, l've zeroed in on two ETFs that seem promising: $GRW and $SUPP.

1. $GRW (Global Compounders ETF): This ETF is all about targeting high-ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) companies with durable moats and sustainable earnings growth. These firms are adept at reinvesting their earnings at high rates of return, essentially compounding capital over time.

2. $SUPP (Supply Chain Logistics ETF): With the current reconfiguration of supply chains and increased emphasis on logistical resilience, $SUPP invests in pivotal players within the logistics and supply chain management sectors.

This ETF aims to leverage the increased capital flows into infrastructure and supply chain optimization amidst global trade recalibrations.

I'm looking for insights on the potential risk-return profiles of these ETFs and their alignment with current macroeconomic indicators. Are there particular volatility concerns or market conditions I should monitor with these investment themes?

Also, if you have other ETFs or securities in mind that align with these themes, please share!

I have researched various philosophy's and have mostly settled on spreading out my investments among growth style mutual funds for the long term. I want to keep it as simple as possible and not need to make any adjustments (if possible). Here are the funds I am thinking:

SWPPX - large cap - 25%

VMACX - mid cap - 25%

DSCGX - small cap - 25%

SWISX - international - 25%

My roth is held with Schwab. I basically googled the best mutual funds I could find among the various types. There is just so much to choose from and look at that I get paralysis in figuring out what is best for me.

AzureRainnn,Advice on investment strategy moving forward as a 22 year old,1722132119,1edwn7u,0,2,"I currently have about 38k sitting in my brokerage account, up about 25% over time (30% if not for the recent tech pullback). All of the brokerage is in individual companies that I do research on but I'm wondering if I should just move everything into an index fund like the VOO?

I've heard people say that since I'm young it's fine to take more risk/reward, but others have said just to put it into VOO. My time horizon is very long (20+ years) and these are some of the biggest positions I own:

madeupofthesewords,Advice for Paying off a Mortgage Early,1722304289,1efhf1h,0,12,"I've been putting in $950 a month to pay off a 25 year mortgage (original loan $228k) at 3.25% with a current balance of $184000. I planned originally to pay it off via ETF's in a brokerage, so I'd built up a brokerage account of $31k (grown $6k since I started).

That $950 was chosen because that would have paid off the house by the age I wanted to retire when I first did an amortization to pay off early by Mid 2032. I'm going to change that to a round $1000.

I might add that I opened a brokerage account as I wanted a secondary backup for emergency savings, but my saving account has built up enough for that not to matter. Therefore I am transferring at $8k a year, starting this year from brokerage into a personal Roth IRA.

So with the above in mind, what are you thoughts on the following options:

a)  Play it safe, and keep on paying the mortgage off early, but now at mid 2033 and pay off the rest with whatever the personal Roth IRA/Brokerage.

b) Invest the $1000 into a work Roth 403b (in additional to my other retirement investments).

If you think b) is the way to go, how would you advise % split into which investments, considering enough growth to have made not going route a) worthwhile, but looking to get around 8%, with a minimum of 6% average growth.

Life_PRN,Limited Principal (brokerage) investing options,1722304691,1efhjur,0,1,"Hello.



I am trying to set my asset allocations on my 403b/457b, but my employer has limited options. We use Principal Investing. There are no total market index funds (US or global). There are large/mid/small cap funds that follow the S&P. There is 1 international option: Janus Henderson Overseas N Fund (JDINX)



I am trying to change my portfolio to follow the global market. I am changing my Roth IRA through fidelity to follow VT, but via fidelity's zero fee options (60/40 FZROX FZILX)



Obviously a majority of my money will go to these Principal accounts (56k between both), while 14k will be going into my and my spouse's Roth IRA.



1.) Has anyone heard of Janus Henderson Overseas N Fund (JDINX), and what are your thoughts on this? It has an ER of 0.80



2.) Would you just blend the Principal funds between large/mid/small? ERs of 0.12, 0.16, and 0.17 respectively.



3.) If I do only US large/mid/small in my 403b/457b, that is approximately 76% of my retirement allocation there. Should I reset my Roth IRA allocations to all international to get close to global market?

* **California High-Speed Rail Project**: This project, intended to connect major cities in California, was originally budgeted at $33 billion but ballooned to over $100 billion. It has faced numerous delays, with only a small section under construction and no clear completion timeline​ ([Senator Rand Paul](https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-releases-2023-festivus-report-on-government-waste/))​​ ([The Beacon](https://blog.independent.org/2023/12/26/2023-festivus-government-waste/))​.
* **Afghanistan Reconstruction Projects**: Billions were invested in various reconstruction efforts, many of which were abandoned or mismanaged, leading to significant waste. Issues included corruption, poor planning, and lack of sustainability​ ([Senator Rand Paul](https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-releases-2023-festivus-report-on-government-waste/))​.
* **Border Wall Construction**: Estimated to cost $15 billion, this project faced numerous challenges and was largely halted with the change in administration. The incomplete sections and subsequent restoration efforts have been costly​ ([Senator Rand Paul](https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-releases-2023-festivus-report-on-government-waste/))​.

These projects highlight significant financial waste due to mismanagement, shifting political priorities, and other issues.

# Funding Corruption:

**2008 Financial Crisis Bailouts**

* **Summary:** The U.S. government bailed out major banks and financial institutions with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), injecting hundreds of billions to prevent a financial system collapse.
* **Corruption:** Executives of bailed-out banks received large bonuses, despite their companies' failures. Some government officials had close ties to these institutions, leading to conflicts of interest and favoritism.

**Automobile Industry Bailout (2008-2009)**

* **Summary:** The U.S. government provided over $80 billion to General Motors and Chrysler to avoid bankruptcy and save jobs.
* **Corruption:** Executives retained high salaries and bonuses. Political connections influenced the distribution of bailout funds, benefiting certain stakeholders disproportionately.

**Airline Industry Support during COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)**

* **Summary:** Over $50 billion in government aid was given to major airlines to cover payroll and prevent bankruptcies.
* **Corruption:** Some airline executives received significant compensation packages. There were instances of misuse of funds, with companies prioritizing stock buybacks and executive pay over employee support.

In all cases, corruption involved individuals within corporations and the government benefiting personally, often at the expense of taxpayers and the broader public interest.

# Bonds being outpaced by Money Supply Inflation:

When examining the return on bonds relative to the rate of debasement (the percentage increase in money supply) over the past decade, we observe that the average growth rate of the M2 money supply has often outpaced bond yields, leading to diminished real returns on bonds.

1. **Money Supply Growth**: Over the past ten years, the M2 money supply in the U.S. has grown significantly. For example, data from the Federal Reserve shows that the M2 money supply increased from approximately $10.5 trillion in 2014 to around $21.02 trillion in 2024​ ([FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL))​​ ([YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_m2_money_supply))​. This represents an average annual growth rate of about 6-7%​ ([YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_m2_money_supply))​​ ([CEIC Data](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/united-states/m2-growth))​.
2. **Bond Yields**: During the same period, the yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds have averaged around 2-3%. These yields are often influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policies and global economic conditions. For instance, post-2008 financial crisis policies kept interest rates low to stimulate the",investing,0.17,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ebdcm7/investing_in_bonds_is_funding_corruption_and/

ME_IN_NYC2311,Need recommendations for a personal finance app,1706988684,1ai42k5,0,1,"I was hoping someone could help recommend a personal finance app. It seems like most apps are focused around creating a budget or tracking spending. I don't care how much I spent on groceries last month, or that my utilities cost $20 more this month than last month, or that kind of thing. I just want something that I can use essentially as a check register. I currently use clearcheckbook.com but twice in the last week have tried to log in only to find the site down. I'm terrified if something ever happened i'd have to way to recreate or reconcile all of my outstanding transactions that haven't cleared yet.

Each month I put in our paychecks, then each bill/transaction we'll be making during the month and then I know that I can save/invest whatever the difference is, and I just check off the transactions throughout the month as they clear.

I track my net worth thru Merrill Lynch, as that's where my retirement accounts are, so i'm not super concerned about the app being able to do that either, but I wouldn't turn it down if that was a feature.

I don't mind paying a small subscription fee as it's worth it to me to work with an app/site where I know my data won't be lost. 

If anyone has any suggestions or ideas I'd appreciate it.

ShotAssistant1452,"A story of hope - $1,000,000",1707096108,1aj4c8b,0,751,"
7 years ago I hit rock bottom - I found out my wife was having an affair which led to a divorce and caused myself and my two kids to move back into my parents house because I could not afford my house payment 

At the time I had $15,000 in retirement and lived pay check to pay check.  At that time I made $60,000 a year

I got serious about my money at that time and started to budget.  I also focused on my savings rate and at least save 20% - 30% into retirement 

A year after the divorce I met a great girl and we got married.  She brought $80,000 of retirement money into our family which gave us about $100,000 in our 403b.  At the time she made $50,000.

7 years later we are making $200,000 a year and have been saving 30% and we now have a net worth over $1,000,000

We still enjoyed vacations, travel sports so we def have not stopped living life.  My biggest advice is we drove cheap cars ( we both have Honda accords that are older) so we never did car payments and used the cheapest car insurance .

A hot stock market helped but now I realize it’s more about savings rate than anything else and just live within your means and eliminate unnecessary debt.

We probably will hit $1,000,000 in stocks alone in another two years

I hold stellantis and am looking into GM, I get the sentiment that stellantis looks really cheap on paper but is falling apart in their product competitiveness and that GM has a lot of liabilities, just like most automakers at the moment, but when big tech is selling at over 30 PE, aren’t legacy automakers the things value investors should be looking for?

Sensitive-Fix8857,Is Palantir the Next Big Tech Stock or Overvalued Hype?,1728164534,1fx14am,0,1,"# Overview

Palantir Technologies Inc. has shown strong performance recently, driven by significant growth in its U.S. commercial and government sectors. The company has been recognized for its ability to deliver enterprise AI solutions at scale, which has been a key differentiator in the market. Recent strategic partnerships and expansions, such as those with Tampa General and Panasonic Energy, highlight its focus on leveraging AI to enhance operational efficiencies. Additionally, Palantir's inclusion in the S&P 500 index and its strategic moves in AI and defense sectors have positively impacted its market perception.

# Fundamental Analysis

* **Revenue and Profitability**: Palantir reported a 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 2024, with total revenue reaching $678 million. The U.S. commercial sector saw a 55% increase, while the government sector grew by 23%. The company achieved a GAAP net income of $134 million, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of profitability. This growth is attributed to strong demand for AI-driven solutions and strategic commercial contracts, although revenue from these contracts is expected to decline. ✅
* **Strategic Positioning**: Palantir is heavily investing in AI and enterprise solutions, with a focus on transitioning from prototype to production. Its strategic partnerships and product innovations, such as the AIP and Warp Speed initiatives, align with its goal to dominate the AI and defense sectors. These efforts are expected to drive long-term growth and strengthen its competitive position. ✅
* **Risks**: Key risks include competitive pressures in the AI sector, potential regulatory challenges, and geopolitical tensions, particularly in regions like the Middle East. These factors could impact Palantir's ability to maintain its growth trajectory and profitability. ⚠️Subscribed

# Technical Analysis

* **Price Movements**: Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility, with a recent surge to a 52-week high of $39.29. The stock has shown strong upward momentum, reflecting positive market sentiment.
* **Key Indicators**: The RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a price correction. The MACD shows a bullish trend, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating strong momentum. ✅
* **Support and Resistance Levels**: Key support is around $30, with resistance at the recent high of $39.29. These levels suggest potential entry and exit points for traders.

# Investment Recommendation

* **Valuation Insights**: With a trailing P/E ratio of 230.82 and a forward P/E of 91.26, Palantir appears overvalued compared to industry peers. However, its strong growth prospects and strategic positioning in AI may justify a premium valuation. ⚠️
* **Short-term Outlook**: Given the current momentum and market conditions, Palantir is expected to continue its upward trend in the short term. Short-term investors might consider a buy, but should be cautious of potential volatility. ✅
* **Long-term Outlook**: Palantir's investments in AI and strategic partnerships position it well for long-term growth. However, investors should be mindful of the risks associated with geopolitical tensions and market competition. Overall, it is a **hold** for long-term investors. ✅
* **Final Recommendation**: Considering both the fundamental and technical analysis, Palantir is a **hold**. While it has strong growth potential, the current valuation and market risks suggest caution. ⚠️",ValueInvesting,0.18,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fx14am/is_palantir_the_next_big_tech_stock_or_overvalued/
EnvironmentalFeed246,"Blue Bird Corp is in value investing territory
",1728427700,1fzcx5g,0,10,"**Context**

**About the company**  
An American school bus manufacturer, who are #1 in US, and are positioned to dominate the market because:

* Highest % of non-diesel buses. Strong focus on electric
* Enjoys strong brand equity primarily for being a specialised player in buses

**Market Size**

* Total school buses: 515K
* Average fleet age: 11 years (most states set 15 years as a replacement target)
* Yearly replacement % - 6-7
* Yearly buses sold #- \~31K
* Yearly buses sold value- $4.5B (Average value \~150K)
* Average value over time has been increasing by 5-10% YOY due to electrification of fleet (EVs cost nearly 3X as much

[Source](https://s23.q4cdn.com/152250413/files/doc_presentations/2024/Aug/19/blbd-investor-presentation-august-2024.pdf)

**Catalysts**

* Infrastructure Law of 2021 authorizes EPA to offer rebates and grants to replace existing school buses with clean / zero-emission models – $5B Funding over 5 years
* 2024 Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicles Program \~$650M for School Buses

The above initiatives have created the following head-winds to expand the market:

* Faster replacement cycles
* Due to focus on clean energy, increase in AOV by about 5-10% every year

Due to these reasons, I would assume the market to grow by at least 5% in terms of volumes, and another 5-10% in terms average value leading to a cumulative growth of 10-15%. In the interest of being conservative, I have modelled 10% revenue growth for the next 5 years

**Valuation**

* Revenue growth over next 5 years: 10%
* Terminal growth: 2%
* Net margin: 7.6% to 8% over 5 years
* Discount rate: 12%

DCF Value: 47 (Stock is trading at a 10% discount)

**Risks**

* Leadership is a big pain. Phil Horlock (63) was to retire and pass the baton to Britton Smith resigned a month before the transition. So Phil Horlock has decided to continue, and is now both the CEO and President. Britton Smith attributed the resignation to personal reasons, but he is now in the market looking for a new job (source: his linkedin profile). If only we knew why Britton Smith **really** left
* Insider selling by the CEO has been relentless. Partly understandable because he is over 60 and would look to diversify funds
* Republican government will not be as generous with clean energy funds

**Overall**

I assume that this is the most conservative valuation of a stock, because it considers how much would you take if the company would simply close the doors and liquidate all of its assets. So, from my point of view, this is the minimum price that the share should be valued at and, if the current price is very close to the tangible assets value per share, I can assume that the future NPV and the future growth is very mispriced by the market. 

I do this calculation by: Tangible Book Value =  Assets - Intangible Assets - Net Debt

I want to know if this calculation and these assumptions are right, and If there is something more to consider in this kind of analysis. I've heard something about the fact that if the asset has been bought in a long time ago, maybe its value on the books is very far from what would be if sold in today's market, but, even though, I can't find a way to adjust that, and mitigate this possible distortion.

1. Their business is recovering medical claims, and they have 'claims recovery rights' worth \~$3B, which is basically all of their assets.   
2. They can't seem to profitably translate these claims recovery rights into actual cash, so they lose money every quarter, at about \~$30M/quarter  
3. Typical scamco dual class share structure where CEO controls voting. Last class A (economic rights) shares are at \~22M and class V (voting only rights, no economic rights) at \~125M.   
4. $4M market cap  
5. Only 'real' assets are $7M in cash as of June 30, 2024, which is surely gone by the time of this writing.   
6. To add insult to injury, the CEO lent $112.8M to the company in June 2022 securing seniority rights to the \~$3B in claims recovery rights  
7. Remaining bondholders likely have little to nothing to actually collect on, and shareholders certainly have nothing to collect on in the inevitable liquidation/bankruptcy.   
8. Meanwhile, they have liabilities of $1.9B. It looks near certain that liabilities $$$ >> 'real' assets $$$. 

Predictably, share sales are not bringing much 'revenue' into this scamco with a market cap at $4M and stock price of $0.15/share. 

So how are they funding this scam? Debt. Now this is something I haven't seen before. Usually equity sales to morons are how these scamcos survive, but this company seems to be getting debt at an incredible rate: 

Q2 2024: +$27.5M  
Q1 2024: +$26.3M  
Q4 2023: +$34.8M  
Q3 2023: +$18.5M

They are funding substantially all of their burn from new debt. Who are the morons lending money to them, and what do they see in the company? I am so lost on this as I have never seen this type of financing before for an endstage scamco. 

I am considering going short, since their burn rate is \~$120M/quarter, and once the debt financing ends, they'll be burning at 3000% of market cap, which is absurd. I'm wondering how long the debt financing can go on, as I would've predicted it would end many quarters ago yet it keeps going...

1. I like Samsung as a company and use all their products (S23 smartphone, Laptop, Monitors, TVs, tablet, All in one Bespoke AI washing Machine, robot Vaccum) The all in one washing machine is amazing by the way and so is the S23 smartphone. I'm not an apple product guy obviously as you can see, but I own a lot of apple stock. It feels wrong that I don't own Samsung stock when I'm a big believer in the products. Samsung sells it's products globally and is competitive with apple.

2. I like poshmark which is owned by Naver.

3. I like kia

4. I like Hyundai

5. I like that S. Korean valuations haven't spiked like here in the U.S.

Napalm-1,What is happening in the uranium sector?,1727785774,1ftmvec,0,98,"Hi everyone,

**A summery of a couple important points**

The uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:

- recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.

- followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)

- recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.

- followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)

- Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.

- Uranium demand is price inelastic

- The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)



**A couple points more in detail:**

**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.

Let me explain

a) The gas price represents \~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!

The uranium price only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105

b) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.

c) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)

Those are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**



**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future

From 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)

Since early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X

But now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024

A good month ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.

Subaru Corp. engages in the manufacture and sale of automobiles, aircraft, engine parts, and industrial machines. It takes the 25th spot for car sales worldwide and the 7th spot in JPN as of 2023.

Market Cap: $12.76 billion  
Total Cash: $12.07 billion (cash $6.91 billion and short term investments $‪‪5.79 billion)  
Total Debt: $3.46 billion  
Enterprise Value (EV): $3.52 billion

OCF: $5.31 billion  
FCF: $4.01 billion  
Net income: $2.66 billion  
EBITDA: $4.84 billion

Debt decreased slightly since 2020, and they pay a solid dividend (Dividend Yield, TTM is 3.32%).

Historical net income data:  
2019: $1.40 billion  
2020: $721 million  
2021: $623 million  
2022: $1.48 billion

Nominal PE (Market Cap/NI) is 4.8  
EV/2023 EBITDA is 352/484 = 0.73 (more conservative approach would only look at $6.91 billion in cash, setting EV at $9.31 billion and EV/EBITDA at 931/484 = 1.9)

Shareholders equity is $16.94 billion so P/B (Market Cap/Shareholders equity) is 1276/1694 = 0.75

Cashflow from operating activities has grown over the last five years. ROE has been volatile over the last years, ranging between 2 and 8 %. Has doubled since 2022 and TTM net income already reached $2.66 billion as of today, so ROE is expected to grow.

Risks:

\*stem mostly from currency risks (if your investing with $/€) and the rising interest. Stronger Yen will also hurt earnings in foreign markets.  
\*dependency on the US market links the stock to the US economy and its consumer spending. New US - JPN tariffs can hurt exports  
\*Subaru is slow in adopting EV's  
\*supply chain disruptions are a common risk for any car manufacturer

Summary:  
low valuation at 4.8 P/E; strong free cash flow; massive cash & equivalents reserves; minimal debt; solid dividend yield at 3.32%; improving ROE with growing profitability; undervalued with 0.75 P/B

Catalysts:  
Slower interest raise than expected by BoJ; tariff threats during Trump era led to 2020 JPN-US trade agreements; US economy shows moderate growth; EV switch might occur slower than anticipated; Subaru supply chains aren't especially vulnerable; has a strong US consumer brand loyalty",ValueInvesting,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ftn1cm/subaru_corp_tse7270/
krisolch,Podcasting Stocks - Acast & Audioboom Valuations (Acast is superior and undervalued imo),1727788647,1ftnv4y,0,5,"Acast & Audioboom are both podcasting companies, acast has the following model.

Both companies sign creators of podcasts on their platform and then place ads in the podcast & distribute this to third party platforms like apple podcast, youtube, spotify etc.

Acast is the superior company, both on underlying KPI's and with management

- Gross margins gone up even in bad recessionary ad market which is insanely impressive. Audiobooms has gone down.

Acast gross margins are 39%, while audiobooms are 19% in normal times (in 2023 they were -3% due to bad contract signings).

Why is that? Well here's Acast's split of revenues:

||
||
|Business Model|Acast|Podcast Creator|
|Brand-produced ads split|50%|50%|
|Sponsorship/host-read ads|30%|70%|
|Non-ad revenue (subs from users + analytics and data etc)|100%|0%|

So you can see they take a healthy % on every podcast. This enables them to hit 39% gross margins overall.

Audioboom on the other hand doesn't disclose this, probably because they have to pay the top tier podcasts on their platform a large % of the revenue to stay on their platform and not churn to another one like Acast.

Tech:

- Acast invented DAI (dynamic ad-insertion), this is where you can programmatically change the ads displayed in your backlog of podcasts to show more relevant ads for today.

- Acast seems to have better tech and is using ML in cool ways such as  whereas audioboom is not.

Example:

> Utilizing AI to analyze podcast content, enabling us to better match brands with suitable podcasts.

Look at audioboom and acast's latest annual reports and it's pretty clear the advantage Acast has on the tech side I think. They seem to be the innovators.

Here's the KPI's of Acast:

||
||
|KPI's|2024 (est)|2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|
|Listens (millions)|4,300.00|5,019.00|5,139.00|3,735.00|2,976.00|1,933.00|

|Sell-through rate||27%|29%|28%|22%|21%|
|ARPL||$0.03|$0.03|$0.03|$0.20|$0.02|

Their listens are projected to decrease to 4.3b in 2024 from 5b in 2023 solely because of a change that apple did with it's podcasting app in late 2023 that hurt all podcasters, here's my note on it, they stopped auto-downloads of podcasts. This is a good thing long term as it means advertisers will get higher ROIC on their ad-spend and thus want to spend more later. Without the IOS change, listens would have been flat YOY they said in an investor call. Partly because podcasting was in a bubble in 2021/2022.

Here's audiobooms KPI's:

||

|Audioboom KPI's|2024 (est)|2023|2022|2021|2020|2019|

|Inventory (millions) (impressions)||7,000.00|4,000.00|4,000.00|1,674.00|1,644.00|

|Average monthly downloads (m)|103.00|121.90|117.10|113.00|81.70|N/A|
|ARPL||$0.109|$0.095|$0.083|$0.072||

You can see these KPI's are much worse than Acast's. They had to increase their ad-slot to 8x from 5x per podcast, this isn't sustainable, you can't just keep increasing ad-slots to boost revenue long term.

Their share of revenue in new podcast deals is only 20-25%\~. This is what leads to lower gross margins.

Risks:

|- Requires top tier podcasts which give majority of revenue. Spotify tried with celibrities that had a bad ROI.|

- ROI. = en légère baisse depuis les années 2024 à 2017 mais il est environ à 32% depuis 2018 (avec une chute à 22% durant 2019, covid) mais il reste quand meme tres grand. 

ROE = augmentation depuis 2014 en passant de 27% en moyenne à 32% en 2023.





Balance Sheet : 



- cash and equivalent en tres jolie hausse depuis 10 ans, et croissance en terme de % en hausse aussi, courbe exponentiel. 

- il y a toujours eu plus de CURRENT assets que de TOTAL LIABILITIES et l’écarterez ne fait que se creuser, il y a plus du double de current assets que de liabilities total/

- current ratio déjà pressure 3 fois supérieur mais en 2024 on se retrouve à 4x supérieur donc 4 fois plus de current assets que de curent liabilities 

- quick ratio on était à 1,76 en 2014 et on se retrouve avec 3,50 en 2023 et toujours avec uneprogressio constante. 

- goodwill constant sauf cette année en 2024 ou il passe de 72 à 241 millions (presque rien comparé à tous les autre resulats mais du à un gros investissement. 



- total debt = la dette totale de hermès est reste tressé très faible jusqu’en 2018 ou elle a explosé passant de 57 à 1166 mais a Gardé son calme jusqua maintenant pur atteindre 2060 en 2023.

- la net debt ne fait que de s’aggrandir d’année en année c’est une cour exponentiel qui s’agrandit donc de plus en plus d’assets pour une dette qui grandis tres légèrement donc très bien controlée. 



- book value / share = pareille courbe exponentiel qui n’est pas encore a son plus haut mais tout est contrôlée et en progression. Bien loin du prix de l’action à 2 200$ je l’accorde mais tout les autres datas sont incroyable est au vert. 

- total debt / equity = de 2014 à 2017 tres tres peu vers 1%, monté à 21/22% jusqu’en 2020 ou depuis ca diminue pour atteindre 13,55% en 2023 donc genial. 



CASH FLOW STATEMENT : 



- total depreciassion & amortization en tres legere hausse mais tres peu face à la grosse augmentation des assets et de l’inventaire et de la valeur du net plant et properties. 

- CAPEX en légère hausse mais bon car investissement toujours régulier

- cash from financing logiquement en perte mais assez régulier mais tout de meme en forte hausse depuis 2021.

- cash from investing aussi, que cash from financing = logic. 

- stock base compensation en hausse tres contrôlée tout en restant à des niveaux bas par rapport à leur revenu…donc ca me va

Fountainheadusa,Pagaya (PGY) is a hidden gem with a lot of potential.,1707846181,1apzguj,0,1,"I own Pagaya $PGY and plan to keep buying up to $1.30 to $1.40. I believe there is tremendous upside left in the stock.  


**These are my reasons to buy:**  


**Pick and Shovel Play** : Pagaya is a Fintech, pick and shovels, AI play providing a platform/software service to commercial lenders like Visa, banks, and even Fintech competitor SoFi Technologies (SOFI). It has an excellent de-risking AI business model at scale for lenders and investors.  


**Low Credit Risk:** Pagaya doesn’t keep any loans on its books, except a small percentage of securitizations made by them for mandatory risk retention compliance.  


**Recurring Fee Based Business**: It charges fees to business clients (lenders) like Visa (V), Ally Financial (ALLY) and SoFi Technologies to provide due diligence and credit analysis of their potential borrowers - sift through their initially-declined loan applications, and find any good loans among the declined ones.  


**Network Model**: Pagaya bundles these loans and moves them to their final destination - investors. 80% of the loans get bundled into ABS, (Asset Backed Securities), which institutional clients have agreed to purchase in advance. The other 20% of the bundled loans are sold to private investors, and Pagaya charges them a fee for that service  


**Switching Costs:** It takes Pagaya and the lender about 2-3 years to complete onboarding and integration. Clients are likely to remain loyal.  
**It has strong capital and institutional Backing:** The Singapore Government Fund, which owns 9% of Pagaya is also a large buyer of ABS.  
**Strong pipeline:** Pagaya has a large and very credible pipeline, a unique business model, which de-risks the lending business in real time and a platform that works across several products and lenders.  


**Challenges, weaknesses and threats**  


**Cyclical:** This is a Cutthroat, Commodity, Cyclical business and sure there is the AI product differentiator, but over time, even M/L or AI platforms or software will become a commoditized business, without significant competitive advantages.  
Network volume flatlined in Q1-2022, at 1.6Bn, then stagnated at $1.9Bn in two quarters of 2022, with even one decrease to $1.8Bn. We finally saw growth renewing in Q1-2023 to $1.9Bn.  


**Barriers to entry are low: F**or example, their lender customers could easily develop the same software. Their lenders who are much bigger, SoFi Technologies itself is $7.5Bn in market cap, a little less than 10 times Pagaya's size, -- could become their biggest competitors by investing in similar AI software for themselves, eliminate Pagaya and shop their own product around like AWS.  


**Dilution:** Another challenge is the possibility of continued dilution. Share count stood at 738Mn shares in Sep 2023 compared to 667Mn in Sep 2022, an increase of 11%...  


**Valuation**  


Pagaya is priced at only 1.05 times sales and with an estimated Sales CAGR of 22%, this drops to 0.6x sales - it had current assets of $419Mn in Sep 2023- that’s about half its market cap of $855Mn ! That's a steal! Compare that to SoFi, which is priced at 3.7X sales and has a 3 year forward CAGR of 19% lower than Pagaya. Plus, SoFi earns only a part of its revenues from services, they earn interest income as well, which carries credit risk.  
They will soon be listed in the US - that itself could be a huge boost.  
And can also benefit from a reverse stock split, which removes the cheaper branding of a $1 stock.  


Sure there are risks, but I believe most of them are already priced in at a low price of $1.13, and the upside could easily be $4 to $5 in a few years.

theWifeisRight,New Ideas to invest a HELOC?,1707943956,1aqxhmk,0,1,"Title: Leveraging a $75K HELOC at 8.5% Interest - Seeking Advice!

Hello r/PersonalFinance!

I’ve recently secured a HELOC for $75K with an interest rate of 8.5%. My job is stable, but just OK in terms of income, pushing me to explore ways to leverage this credit line to increase my financial standing. Given the relatively high-interest rate, I'm cautious about how to proceed and would greatly appreciate your insights.

My financial situation is stable, with no significant debts besides a mortgage, and I have an emergency fund in place. I’m intrigued by the idea of using this HELOC to potentially create a new income stream or invest in a way that could offer returns higher than the interest rate I'm facing.

I've considered a few avenues:
1. **Real Estate**: Buying a rental property, although I'm aware that the market can be unpredictable.
2. **Stock Market**: Particularly dividend-paying stocks or ETFs, though the current market volatility is a concern.
3. **Starting a Business**: I have a couple of ideas but haven't fleshed them out fully. The risk here is evident.
4. **Debt Consolidation**: Though not an investment, it's an option to streamline finances.
5. **Education/Training**: Investing in myself to potentially increase my earning power in the future.

I’m leaning towards options that balance risk with a reasonable expectation of beating the interest rate of the HELOC. I’m here for any advice, experiences, or alternative ideas you might have. How can I smartly utilize this $75K to grow my wealth despite the high-interest rate?

2timeBiscuits,Should we go to cash when the Fear and Greed Index is at extreme greed?,1708036012,1ars79s,0,1,"If you can read..

I'm sure you've seen the latest update on the Fear and Greed Index indicating extreme greed.

There are some warning signs that the economy is slowing down, such as:

- The real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which measures the change in the unemployment rate, is at 0.2%, which is close to the threshold of 0.5% that signals the start of a recession
- The Conference Board Leading Economic Index, which tracks 10 indicators of future economic activity, declined by 0.1% in December 2023, the first drop since April 2020.
- The OECD Composite Leading Indicator, which covers 37 countries and regions, fell by 0.1 point to 99.6 in November 2023, the lowest level since June 2020.

I think there is an 85% chance of a recession in the United States stock market in the next 12 months. 

I'm wondering per $100,000 invested (100% in US stocks — how much CASH should you hold in money market fund ready to BUY 

Should I go to 50% cash, 30% cash, or something else? What are the pros and cons of each option? How would you adjust your portfolio in this situation?

mintmarca7410,"Riding the Dragon: Autonomy, EVs, and the Great Chinese Economic Rodeo",1708036761,1arsi6q,0,1,"In the intricate dance of global economics and technological advancement, two titans stand out: the United States and China. Here's a distilled essence of their current trajectory:  
1. Regulatory Dichotomy: The U.S. presents a regulatory mosaic, with state and federal laws creating a complex tapestry of driving regulations. Conversely, China operates under a unified federal system, spearheaded by Xi Jinping, an unchallenged architect of policy.  
2. Autonomous Ambitions: This contrast in governance models suggests a divergent path toward the adoption of autonomous vehicles. The U.S., with its regulatory labyrinth, might find itself trailing, whereas China's streamlined approach positions it at the forefront, potentially accelerating Chinese dominance in the autonomous vehicle sector through invaluable real-world data accumulation.  
3. Economic Transitions: Yet, the broader economic canvas reveals China amidst a seismic shift from a manufacturing behemoth to a service-oriented giant. This transition, fraught with volatility, casts a shadow over the Chinese stock market, hinting at protracted growing pains that could extend into the Year of the Horse (2027), as growth rates recalibrate from explosive to sustainable.  
**Strategic Insights:**  
**Bullish on XPEV:** In the realm of electric vehicles and autonomous technology, XPEV emerges as a beacon of innovation. This is a nod to their forward-thinking approach in a sector poised for exponential growth.

The S&P 500 asset allocation specifically is what has me worried. Currently 33% of the asset allocation is in technology, with 2nd place being financial services at 12%, 3rd healthcare at 11%. The gap difference from 3rd to 4th onwards is fairly humble, being only 1-5% difference. And yet the gap difference between tech and financial services is a whopping 21%. Its obvious as to why, technology is the largest industry for most of the 21st century and our relience on it in our daily lives shows how dominant it is. 

Technology is also a really broad industry and really should be sub categorised. 

But despite that fact, i have a looming worry over whether much of the earnings and revenue gains of the top 7 companies of the 500 is purely due to Ai Hype. Not to mention the top 7 companies in the 500 holding more than 30% of the total allocation of the 500 fund. 

Is AI proving to be a productive industry? Or is the hype unwarranted. I work with AI in my day job and i definitely see the benefits and productive use of it. Its likely a new industrlial revolution.

There has been a general atmosphere of fearmongering occuring where i am constantly hearing the s&p 500 is in a bubble and ready to pop. But the reasons people are giving differ. Some say its purely ai, others say simply because its a top heavy allocation within a handful of companies, others say its an overreliance on the tech industry as a whole, or some say its because of the growth heavy asset state of the s&p. Ive also seen the comparison to the .com bubble but i have to disagree with this as Ai has tangible productive capabilities which generate work and make processes more efficient (though not all ai tools are made equal, its just a general statement), whereas the .com bubble was for the most part not comparible. Investors just threw money at domains with .com as a suffix without analysing the productive capabilities of those companies.

However id be lying if i didnt say the top heavy concentration of asset allocation with the s&p 500 is making me a little worried. Afterall the point of an index fund is to mitigate risk and over exposure to a limited number of industries and markets, so the current state of the 500 fund does have me a bit worried.

Id be interested to hear some differing perspectives. ",investing,0.29,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1edx5gy/what_is_your_honest_and_educated_in_the_current/

Paradoxbuilder,When do you know it's time to go it alone and ditch your FA?,1707211651,1ak5vkk,0,3,"I started my investing journey about 10 years ago after receiving a windfall. I think I did ok (didn't lose any money) but my returns weren't that good, all things considered. 3-4% for some years and 4-6% in other years. 

I was doing a more thorough audit of my finances this year and I regretted not just putting everything in a few choice ETFs...until I remind myself that I didn't know then what I know now. Plus there were other factors in the way such as family entanglements and unhealed mental illness. 

I initially thought that to be an Investor (TM) you needed to understand every single thing on every broadsheet and watch the markets 24/7...until I did more reading and spoke to a friend of mine who is a full-time investor and she says that she doesn't know all that. You need to know enough to make money consistently, that's it.

So I while do know what are alpha, beta, Sharpe Ratio, candlestick theory are etc...I just want to manage my money, I'm not trying to become a CPA. For what it's worth, most FAs that I speak to are impressed with my knowledge base. 

However, I believe in always being humble and learning more, hence this post. Is there a point to when you feel that you can go it alone? When Googling this question the answer that always comes back is ""everyone's situation is different"" different factors etc. But here I'm talking mainly about financial knowledge and how to apply it.

Basically at this point I would be happy to buy several Vanguard growth ETFs and kick back and relax while saving the fees that I pay my FA. As long as I am navigating any potential traps like not paying witholding taxes, I don't see any issues with that strategy as it's hard to beat the market. The S&P and related ETFs are gold standards for a reason, and some of the funds rebalance themselves. 

tldr; do I know enough to invest safely long-term?

MakingMoneyIsMe,The Stigma of Stock Picking,1707317048,1al4igr,0,1,"Stock picking often gets a bad rap, therefore redditor's often default to suggesting new investors purchase the S&P or any comparable fund. Though this could be considered the safe route, it does little to teach new investors about the market as a whole. 

Stock picking is like a dark art, and is something I vowed to learn and master early on (or at least quit losing money in). Firstly, diversification is important. There's no way around it. Your level of diversification can vary, but owning an excessive amount of companies will only assure you'll do average at best.

Many give Cramer flak, but there's one comment he'd often make I'd like to highlight: ""Buy best of the best"". If you opted to buy the best companies per sector, beating the market isn't impossible...but picking stocks is half of the equation. ""Buying a wonderful company at a fair price"" is the other half.

I often stress the psychology of investing. Something I didn't become cognizant of until I started day trading. The market often pulls in new investors during euphoria, and this is the absolute worst time to invest. 

Many novice (and somewhat experienced) investors can't stomach market corrections, so be mindful of the affect a correction can have on someone who got in at the highs during euphoric conditions. A 10% drop in a stock isn't something to lose sleep over for someone who's up 100% or so...but imagine the affect a 10% drop can have on a new investor. They'll likely want to stop the bleeding, considering they'll immediately be in the red. 

Resist following the herd. Usually when some shiny new thing is being touted on social media, smart money is already looking for the exit. Invest in companies you can understand. Invest in products you already use or would consider using, granted they have sustainable growth. I often avoided shopping at Walmart because it was always crowded. I decided to research the company to determine what that traffic translated to. That was around $52 a share. I realized when you turn on every computer, you were greeted by Microsoft Windows. That was $38 a share. It can be that simple.

Investors definitely shouldn't be deterred from stock picking. Just be cognizant of the business and disciplined in your entry.

How would you distribute these two fund for US investments?
1) leave as is, 66% SP500 and 33% RSCC
2) switch to 86% SP500 and 14% RSCC to match market Cap
3) have all my US funds just SP500

To meet these criteria, the YoY revenue growth will be <10% & there is generally a problem with the forward-looking story.

Stocks include: Alibaba (before recent boom), Paypal, Expedia, Lyft, Bumble, Twilio, HP Enterprise, LegalZoom, Pagaya, Coursera, Zoom, Dropbox, Materialise NV, etc. By design, none of these are ""exciting"" by Reddit standards.

Reasoning: These are profitable with a strong balance sheet, so there are no bankruptcy issues. The story in the tech industry changes rapidly with new innovations, unlike non-tech value stocks. I believe \~half of these stocks (hard to predict which ones) will increase revenue growth & significantly increase their market value over 1-2 years.

I don't think we will have more than 8% per year at current valution without a major bear market.  It's healthy to have a bear market to deflate valuation a little bit then have a new bull run. 

  
Did some simple investigations on role of PE expansion on SP500 return. 

Here's what I found: 

1985 to Oct, 2007: 9.9%/year return

4.25%/year is from PE10 expansion

Return excluding PE expansion: 5.65%



Oct, 2007 to 2024: 8.1%/year return

1.8%/year  is from PE10 expansion

Return excluding PE expansion: 6.3%



Feb, 2009 to 2024: 13.5%/year return

7.06%/year  is from PE10 expansion

Return excluding PE expansion:6.44%



So return of SP500 without PE expansion was consistently around 6%/year.

Verified: 1932 and 1982 with same PE10 , returned 6%/year

mahatmacondie,CROX - Due Diligence - Crocs Shoes,1728451042,1fzk48g,0,18,"I posted this as a comment to another post, but since I spent some time putting it together I wanted to make a dedicated post to see what you all thought about this name!

I believe CROX is undervalued at ~10 P/E. It's growing and has great margins, but share price has been hammered by a disappointing acquisition and is generally overlooked due to the nature of their core product and brand. 

Pros 

- very reasonable TTM and FWD P/E in the 10-11 range, whereas direct comps (SKX, NKE, ONON, DECk) trade in the 17-29x range. 

- A cult-like following with their customer base, the majority of which is young people. 

- Consistent revenue and FFO growth, utilizing FCF to buyback shares and pay down debt. 

- Tons of celebrity endorsements (Sydney Sweeney, LeBron, Pos Malone, Pharell, etx) and brand collaborations (marvel, McDonald's etc) have helped them ride the casual/comfort trend that arose out of COVID lockdowns. 

- affordable product as consumers seek to save money across the board

- anecdotally, the store near me is always insanely packed when I pass by on weekends. They had to post a sign with max occupancy and there's an employee manning the door and managing a line of people 5-15 strong waiting to get into the store. 

- current buyback plan amounts to ~10% of market cap. 

- accessories offered (charms called jibbitz) add to the uniqueness and personalization of the footwear. They seem silly to me, but their vibe seems to be about unique/silly offerings (mainly for kids) and these accessories have great margins. 

- core brand Crocs growing at a double digit clip. 

Cons

- fashion industry can be fickle and subject to trends changing. 

- acquisition made in 2021, heydude, not only has the dumbest fucking name on the planet, but more importantly hasn't been as successful as hoped, and that portion of the business is now shrinking. mgmt notes some of this is due to changes in wholesale/distribution strategy to match Crocs brand, and there's hope the brand has bottomed and will start to rebound. They are investing in the brand (Sydney Sweeney endorsement deal. and hiring of Terrance Reilly as president of the brand). The brand itself does have a different (more mainstream) aesthetic which can provide some level of diversification for the business. 

- their shoes are inherently somewhat ugly, albeit different and fun in ways that speak to their audience. 

I do believe this last point may create some sort of ceiling for the business/multiple, but if it can just reach a 17x P/E, which is equivalent to the lowest P/E for a competitor in their industry (Skechers) it would be a 50%+  increase for shareholders.

**1.    Introduction:**

Founded in 1988, Innovative Solutions and Support (ISSC) is a specialized systems integrator and manufacturer in the avionics industry, designing and producing advanced cockpit systems for both commercial and military aircraft. Initially led by founder Geoffrey S. M. Hendrick, a prominent figure in avionics who held nearly 100 patents, ISSC quickly became a key player in the industry. Under Hendrick's leadership, the company capitalized on regulatory changes like Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM), leading to a surge in demand for its air data systems and driving revenues to a peak of $63 million in 2006. Over time, ISSC shifted its focus to flat panel display retrofits for older aircraft, establishing a niche position in cockpit avionics. The company has evolved with time developing products that were demanded by the market, with their current product offering they will be able to capitalize on aviation trends such as autonomous flight.



ISSC's earnings bottomed in 2018, as the company faced challenges in turning around its operations. A significant portion of their revenue, over 20%, came from engineering development contracts, which were burdened with razor-thin margins. Compounding this, the company had to dedicate substantial resources to research and development (R&D), when including internal R&D expenses the number approached 40% of total revenues.

After Hendrick's passing in 2022, Shahram Askarpour, the former President of Engineering, took the helm as CEO. ISSC has successfully turned around its operations after divesting from almost all their engineering development contracts, improving margins and achieving a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20% since 2018. Management remains optimistic about the company's future, confident in its ability to sustain double-digit organic growth. Several catalysts, including the complete sale of shares from the late CEO's trust, new contracts, and increased investor interest, are poised to significantly boost ISSC’s stock price.

Despite not providing formal guidance, ISSC’s leadership has expressed their expectation to grow revenues beyond the $100 million mark in the future. The company is even preparing for expansion by considering the construction of a new manufacturing facility. With its strong foundation, history of innovation, and strategic leadership, ISSC is well-positioned for continued growth and success in the avionics sector.

 

**2.    Business segments:**

Innovative Solutions and Support (ISSC) operates across three primary business segments: Product Sales, Customer Service, and Engineering Development Contracts. Each segment plays a crucial role in generating revenue and driving the company's growth.

Fun-Imagination-2488,AAP is the worst … time to buy it,1727808225,1ftvmy5,0,17,"Very simple thesis / elevator pitch

•	⁠AAP sells the same products as AutoZone, at a similar price.
•	⁠AAP has 4,935 stores.  AutoZone has 6,443 stores.
•	⁠Autozone TTM revenue is at $17.98bn.  AAP TTM revenue is at $11.27bn.
•	⁠Autozone marketcap $54.11Bn.  AAP marketcap $2.28bn.  This implies an obscenely high risk/reward ratio for AAP. 

But why is AAP priced lower?  MARGINS


•	⁠AAP has far worse profitability… this is the only thing I believe can justify a price reduction even close to what the market has done.  Honestly, I believe AAP is a takeover candidate at today’s price.  

•	⁠I have spoken to roughly 20 people working in this industry, and every single one of them either said Advance Auto Parts provides the best service or that they flip flop 50/50 between AutoZone and Advance.

- AAP’s biggest issue has been their margins.   Currently sitting at 0% profit margin, while AutoZone has a 15% profit margin.  Im convinced that if they fix this issue, we have ourselves a 15 bagger over 2-5 years.

•	⁠When the margins across the industry are around 12-15%, but AAP, which is a solid company, is sitting at 0%.  This screams unsustainable.  Some companies perform at high levels that are unsustainable, but this level of incompetence, in my view, is so unlikely to continue. 


- They hired Shane O’Kelly from Home Depot to solve the problem.  Which I believe was an absolutely massive win.  That alone drove the stock, briefly, from $48 to $80.  Over the past year, insiders have been buying stock non-stop.   The sale of Worldpac gives them the runway necessary to make this turnaround extremely likely.  They have time and money available pull off this turnaround off easy.

In terms of levelized cost of energy, its one of the most expensive.

Thats on top of massive skilled labor shortages in the nuclear industry and the issue with nuclear waste. I know one argument is for baseload energy, but with battery storage solving the intermittency of wind and solar, I don't really see that argument. It only takes 800 wind turbines to match the energy of a nuclear reactor. That may seem like a lot until you consider that the US already has 70,800  installed.

From MarketWatch:

> Wall Street fund managers are now extremely bullish, the closely watched BofA Fund Manager survey revealed. Fund managers have slashed their holdings in cash and Treasury bills to low levels: At an average of 4.2% of assets, cash levels are now down about a third since October, **and are a whisper from the 4% level that BofA, historically, considers an automatic sell warning**[my Reddit emphasis added]. Meanwhile, fund managers are now more heavily invested in U.S. stocks than at any time since November 2021

That is the paragraph that got my attention. First, I don’t think I’d ever seen that stat before. % cash if surveyed fund mgrs 

I can’t say it’s alarming. (And I took out a few adjectives and adverbs that made the article more sensational.) it depends on how smart you think fund mgrs are.

The author says than when the fund managers are soft on an industry, there are often good buys, because they are value priced based on the fund managers avoiding them. Of course, they *could* be avoiding sectors for good reasons. 

It’s questionable whether the fund managers are knowledgeable or not. But what is without question is wherever they go, they’re going to raise asset prices. Because they’re in command of so much money. It’s like the ETF principle. Or being added to the S&P 500.

So this is also what the report showed:

> Right now, fund managers are heavily invested in U.S. stocks and in bonds. Their most popular sectors are technology, communication services, and pharmaceuticals. Outside of the U.S., they are also big on Japanese equities

> Their least favorite sectors are energy, materials, banks and utilities. Their least favorite regions are Europe (especially London, but actually the whole continent) and emerging markets.

Where there are avoiding seems pretty reasonable and rational. Banks are completely in the air, while the fed tries to make up its mind. 

I’m surprised they are in Bonds at this time, but it doesn’t really say how much or what kind. Pharma is also surprising. I’ve been looking at AstraZeneca for a long ass time now and every time I take a half step toward buying some, it tanks. Which reminds me that I don’t understand the industry very well.

So a lot of money that was on the sidelines, as of last October, is in the market and it’s focused on tech, communications, pharma. And you can see the first two definitely being pushed, as if it needed any help. But I don’t see a whole lot of movement in Pharma unless I’m looking in the wrong places.

But what do you think it says about fund managers being optimistic and invested with both feet?",investing,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aqyg44/want_to_chase_the_stockmarket_rally_read_this/

Kyle-SMMA,How many individual stocks in your eyes is too much?,1708189200,1at6jsw,0,14,"Out of curiosity how many individual stocks in your eyes is too much? 

My train of thought behind my pickings is that I allocate the majority of my money to a world index so I’m not overweighting a particular sector or region but then allocate a small portion of my funds to individual stocks that I personally use day to day and have high confidence in.

For reference, 66% of my money is tied up in a world index (VWRL). 12% is tied up in small cap index funds. 50% in USA and 50% in Europe. (ZPRV and ZPRX)

11% is tied up in individual stocks. The list of stocks are:

Amazon - I use this quite frequently since I’m a member.

Apple - I use their tech.

Microsoft - familiar with their business model and use their software such as word and PowerPoint.

Meta - I use instagram and WhatsApp, I don’t use Facebook but its power in advertising is immense.

Johnson & Johnson - leader in health such as vaccines.

Visa & Mastercard - I personally use Mastercard but both are identical and leaders.

Alphabet - I use their software.

AMD - gaming as they’re used in Xbox and PlayStation plus their future in AI. Taking market share from intel.

Berkshire Hathaway - diversified

McDonald’s - real estate company that sells food.

JP Morgan - leading bank that is diversified.

Caterpillar - leading manufacture in mining/ agriculture/ construction machinery. Plus I’ve got a placement sorted with them so there’s a bit of bias lol.

Nvidia - leader in AI and GPU production.

Walmart - powerhouse in America.

Costco - their membership model is cash flow powerhouse plus they’re present in numerous countries.

Waste management - trash will always be here.

ASML - absolute gem of a company and many years ahead of any competitors. Every tech company t is reliant on them.

Airbus - I love planes and their business is far more desirable than Boeing.

Coinbase - I use them to invest in crypto which I believe in.

Once again, I’ve chose to invest into these companies individually as I want to overweigh them as I’m more confident in them than others. I’m willing to put my money where my mouth is. I’m aware they’re contained in the world index. I don’t do any technical analysis, it’s all confidence and familiarity.

I also invest in REITs, I invest into leading REITs in each sector such as industrial, data etc. 11% of my portfolio is in REITs. 10 in total. I use alreits to track them, and track them quarterly.

I don’t plan on selling until retirement. Currently 19.

The USD has always intrigued me. For being one of the strongest currencies in the world, it also has the biggest debts. There is some speculation that the US will attempt to solve its debt by devaluing its currency.   
If the government were to do this, the implications would be numerous. For instance, those who have invested in its currency (in the form of US-domiciled index funds)  would face a loss.

No-Surprise-5875,Advice Request: Am I thinking straight?,1722000841,1eco7x9,0,1,"Hi everyone,

I’d like some advice from the community to see if I’m thinking clearly on my current retirement plan.

Basics:

I’m 30 years old, bringing in roughly $120,000 annually between base salary and bonuses. 

I work for one of the largest companies in the world and receive a 6% 401K match. 

I currently have roughly $90,000-$100,000 in my ROTH 401K. (Depending on market swings)

I currently have roughly $30,000-$40,000 in my ROTH IRA. (Depending on market swings)

I am currently putting 14% into my Roth 401K, split between the Russell 2000 and the Russell 1000. Those are the best investments offered through my company and I’m up around 10-12% this year. 

I am currently putting around $2,000 a year into my Roth IRA, and more when I have extra funds laying around. 

Here’s the main question:

Would you continue pumping cash into the Roth 401K to see the total amount grow larger and see compound interest kick in faster, or would you decrease the 401K contribution to 6% and use the other 8% to max out the yearly Roth IRA limit? 

My assumption is that I will make money faster over the long term via the Roth 401K since its value is almost 3 times larger than my current IRA. 

Thoughts and opinions are much appreciated.

At the moment I have a significant position in Gorilla Technologies Group, GRRR. It has a fairly high short interest rate of 280% and the shorts are utilized 100%.

So enabling short lending would earn me a few thousand dollars every month:

But I just checked the regulations, and my broker states:  
'The provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") may not protect you as a   
lender with respect to securities loan transactions in which you lend your Fully-Paid Securities. Therefore, the collateral delivered to you (and indicated on your account statement) may   
constitute the only source of satisfaction of obligation in the event that the broker fails to return the   
securities.'  


So to me that means in the unlikely but possible event of a short squeeze the borrowing party might go belly up. I would then only receive the value of the stocks **before** the squeeze.

VorTuxD17,So recently I came across this interesting trading site/app...,1707004400,1ai9yt2,0,1,"(First of all, this is meant only as a sharing of my discovery, in no way as an advertisement!)

So I was scrolling through Instagram the other day and I came across an advertisement of an interesting trading site called **Profit (.com)**. The ad caught my attention with the headline and design, so I clicked on it and it redirected me to a very pleasant looking and functioning website. **Profit (.com)** **is a British company founded in 2019**. Of course, I already know a lot of trading sites and exchanges, so I wanted to know how this one should be different, better. Right at the beginning of the website, the company presents a feature where you can participate in **trading tournaments** and supposedly have the opportunity to win rewards in the form of real money or their virtual currency, which you can then use, for example, to buy trading signals, lives (for the next tournaments) or other things in their store.  
  
I examined their website more closely and I would summarize the products they offer as follows:  
  
The functions they offer include a **terminal** with detailed data needed for trading *indices, commodities, cryptocurrencies, ETFs, etc*....**messenger** (forum) where you can discuss with other users, **articles and news** from the world of investments, **widgets**, **charts**, **signals**, **libraries** and various other materials and tools for making the right decisions in trading. They also have a very well-managed mobile application. For individuals they offer **3 subscription plans**, one of which is free but has enough features from the other two paid plans. The other two cost $10 and $30 per month when purchasing an annual subscription. For businesses they have a choice of **2 plans**.  
  
They also present themselves as **the best alternative** among several financial platforms (such as *Bloomberg Terminal, Trading View, Google Finance, etc.*), which you can see in more detail in their provided table (which is, of course, a little biased towards them).  
  
After a few days of using their program, I am pleasantly surprised by the number of things they offer and the overall feeling of using the site/app, and I strongly consider buying a subscription, to be honest.  
  
I hope that this discovery of mine is exactly what someone is looking for. **If you are interested in this site and want to give it a shot, the link is here**: https://profit.com/  
  
or **if you would also like to support me a little, you can use the following link instead**: https://profit.com/affiliate?ref=odfimzz (it is an affiliate link, but it will still take you to their site)

theDOMSisReal,Diversification as a 30yo,1707005361,1aiabe9,0,1,"I’m getting into the investment game a little late. 

Background info. Single, no kids, 30[M] military veteran who decided to go back to school to finish his bachelors as a full time student (read: unemployed). For the next 2.5 years I will essentially have a fixed income that averages out to $5650/mo, completely tax free. Because these are VA benefits, I technically have no taxable income. 

I currently have 10k in a rainy day fund, and 5k in a 6month CD @ 5.25%. 0 credit card debt, and since the va is paying for school I will have no student loans. I’m living in a subsidized apt in NYC, so I think I can reasonably set aside $1500/month and then still live pretty comfortably. 

I know traditional wisdom says that at this age I should be doing 30% in bonds and 70% in stocks. But I’m thinking since I missed out on investing in my 20s, maybe I want to be closer to 20/80? Also, I decided to put that first 5k into the CD mentioned above because I couldn’t find a bond that could beat that rate. For the time being, are CD’s a better move than bonds? 

Beyond that, I’m thinking of doing 20% in CD/Bonds, 40% in a Roth ETF and chill (since my income isn’t taxable, I’ll never pay taxes on that money right?) and then 40% in some moderate-risk, independently managed stocks.

Eaxecx,Bitcoin - unredeemable numbers mistaken for money,1707117619,1ajaslj,0,1,"Suppose you take a pencil and write ""100"" on a piece of paper. Did you create money by doing so? Something valuable? How much of goods or services is your record worth? One beer? A haircut? A car? House? Obviously, it is impossible to determine something like that. The number itself is not money but mathematical abstraction and has no value. Regardless of whether you write down 1, 100, 1,000 or a million, it's all equally worthless.

For a number to be money, it must be redeemable by its issuer. What does that mean? Let's say that your paper with ""100"" on it is a security that entitles the bearer to 100 bushels of corn. You are a farmer and have issued a paper with the number 100 indicating a specific amount of corn that you will give to whoever brings that paper. That means that the number 100 is redeemable. That it has redemption value. As its issuer, you took the liability to redeem it for a specific quantity of the commodity. Consequently, it is easy to determine how much beer or haircuts are worth giving for it, and it can be used as money.

Euros, dollars or pounds work similarly. They are numbers - either on banknotes or bank accounts, but redeemable numbers. Their issuers - banks, took the liability to redeem them for debt servicing and liens release. Namely, these numbers are issued as debt and are recorded as assets of banks in their balance sheets. Individuals and companies owe them to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe them to central banks based on bonds. The same numbers are also recorded in the balance sheets as banks' liabilities. Banks are liable to redeem them for reducing or closing the debt they created and releasing liens on the property that secures it. In short, the numbers have redemption value and can be money. For example. If a bank is liable to remove a lien from a car title when a debtor returns the number 20,000 to it, the value of that number is equal to the value of the car. That number can be used as money because based on the size of the bank's liability one can determine how much beer or haircuts are worth giving for it.

Now we finally come to Bitcoin. According to popular belief, Bitcoin is money. Given the above, let's see if this is true. When you 'buy Bitcoin' all you get is a number next to the short name of that 'currency', e.g. '5.4321 BTC'. But, did its issuer Satoshi Nakamoto take the liability to redeem it for something? Or generally, did he take the liability to redeem all the numbers that he issued through the protocol he authored and whose sum he limited to 21 million? Well, no. He took no such liability. If you invested electricity to cryptographically and decentrally store these numbers and got some of them in the process, Nakamoto won't redeem them even for a dime.

That means that Nakamoto's numbers are not money. It is impossible to determine how much beers or haircuts to trade for 5.4321 or any other number. There is a well known example of a pizzeria owner who gave two pizzas for the number 10.000. Why did he accept that number and not 5, 100 or 800,000? Well, there is no rational reason. He accepted it blindly. There was no redemption value represented with Nakamoto's numbers to compare it with the value of two pizzas and determine what number is worth accepting. So he accepted 10,000 blindly, for fun reasons.

Nakamoto's numbers are literally like taking a pencil and writing ""100"" on a piece of paper. It's just that Nakamoto writes it digitally. Currently, people are paying $40 million for that number. Due to misconception of unredeemable numbers being money, people pay the equivalent of 40 houses for a worthless mathematical abstraction in the form of ""100"". In addition, they waste huge amounts of electricity to decentrally store such abstractions. It is a market mania that has never been seen in human history. How long it will last no one knows. But what is sure is that it will not end well.",investing,0.15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ajaslj/bitcoin_unredeemable_numbers_mistaken_for_money/

christophermatar,the most undervalued and tax-efficient yields in the world,1707226957,1aka17j,0,1,"The story of how oil and gas tax benefits came to be is as rich and layered as the deposits these industries tap into beneath the earth's surface. It's a tale that intertwines with the very fabric of American history, innovation, and economic strategy, revealing why today, oil and gas investments stand as some of the most undervalued and tax-efficient yields in the world.

To encourage exploration and production after the past energy crisis, the U.S. government implemented a series of tax incentives. These were not merely financial perks but strategic tools aimed at securing the nation's energy independence. The Intangible Drilling Cost (IDC) deduction, for example, allowed companies to deduct expenses from drilling new wells, an essential move to keep the rigs turning and the oil flowing. Similarly, the Depletion Allowance recognized the inherent decrease in value of oil and gas fields as they were depleted, offering a way to offset this loss against income.

\- The Intangible Drilling Cost (IDC) and Depletion Allowance are tax incentives for the oil and gas industry in the U.S. The IDC lets companies deduct drilling costs immediately.  
\- The Depletion Allowance reduces taxes on income from wells to account for resource depletion. Both were introduced to boost investment in oil and gas exploration, aiding U.S. energy independence efforts.

\-Lease costs, like the expenses for leasing minerals and rights, can be spread out over the lease's duration, offering tax advantages over time. Tangible Drilling Costs (TDCs) cover equipment used in drilling and can be depreciated over seven years. These tax incentives, along with the strong return on investment (ROI) potential in direct energy investments, make the sector an attractive choice for investors seeking tax efficiency and profitability.

  
These incentives did more than just stimulate growth in the oil and gas sector; they wove it into the very economic and energy fabric of the nation, making the U.S. a global energy leader. Yet, as the world shifts towards renewable energy, the narrative around oil and gas has evolved. The irony is that, in this transition, oil and gas investments have become some of the most undervalued assets, despite their continuing critical role in powering the modern world.  
Even as we champion the rise of renewables and the march towards electrification, the reality remains: the modern world continues to rely on the efficiency and flexibility of oil and gas. This is especially true as we navigate the complexities of integrating renewable sources into our energy grid, which still requires the reliability and on-demand power that fossil fuels provide. The shift to a more electric and renewable future doesn't negate the value of oil and gas; rather, it highlights their enduring importance in our energy mix.  
The tax benefits initially crafted to ensure energy independence have, somewhat unexpectedly, positioned oil and gas investments as some of the best tax-efficient yields available. Investors who recognize this stand to not only gain from the sector's undervalued status but also contribute to a balanced and pragmatic approach to our energy future.

k_ristovski,"Deep dive into Starbucks - Optimized for choice, not profit.",1728482504,1fzs4mo,0,21,"**1.0 Introduction**

Starbucks isn't just a coffee chain; it's a place where your drink comes with a version of your name on the cup. While this small detail doesn’t change the quality of the product, it has a big impact on customers:

1. **Personalization** - People naturally crave recognition, and this simple interaction taps into that need, making the experience feel more personal, even if it is just a name on a cap.
2. **Customer engagement** - Calling out names for orders, often with humorous misspellings, creates a memorable experience that extends beyond the store. Countless social media posts about these misspellings have gone viral, and this kind of engagement works to Starbucks' advantage.

The customer-centric culture is what allowed the company to grow to almost 40,000 locations worldwide (\~18,000 in the U.S.).



**2.0 The struggle**

Starbucks is perceived as a company with a strong brand.

***But is that true?***

***What does it mean?***

***What does a strong brand bring to the table?***

A strong brand has **pricing power**. It can charge premium prices and raise them in an inflationary environment, **without experiencing a decline in the quantity of products (or services) sold.**

The revenue formula for a company of this kind is simple:

**Revenue** = **Quantity of products sold** x **Price.**

Over the last decade, there have been some inflationary times.

Based on Finance Buzz, Starbucks increased the prices of their products by 39%, the lowest among the chains included in the research. This is slightly above the inflation rate, so it can be argued that the company managed to fully pass the costs to the final customer.

However, the second part of the equation was the **quantity.** A company with strong pricing power should not experience a decline in the amount of products (or services) sold. Unfortunately, this isn’t true for Starbucks.

The company has experienced lower revenue for two quarters in a row compared to the same quarters in the prior year. Their comparable store sales have decreased, meaning they **bring less revenue per store despite the price increase.** **This isn’t a characteristic of a company with a strong brand and pricing power.**

The CEO at the time, Laxman Narasimhan had a terrible CNBC appearance after the Q2 results. His explanation for the poor results was “***We didn’t communicate the value we provide***” - Which I find ridiculous. I don’t think the reason for the poor results is a lack of communication.

But, it gets worse. In the quarterly, release, there was a section related to the strategic priorities. The one that caught me by surprise was **“Become truly global”.** What does this even mean? Isn’t a company with \~40,000 locations “global” enough?



**3.0 The actual reasons for the struggle**

So, what is happening? **Why is Starbucks struggling?** While studying the company in depth, I’ve identified the following 4 reasons:

1. **More is not always better** - The menu continues to expand, offering more options and customizations. When the orders start shifting away from standard to customized, it leads to longer times to prepare a beverage. This leads to **fewer drinks** being prepared (and sold) per hour and **longer waiting times**. From a financial point of view, the cost per beverage goes up, and then it is passed on to the final customer. However, why should the customers pay more? What changed? For many, the waiting time increased. Ultimately, many customers (including loyal ones) decided that the current value for money offered by Starbucks wasn’t worth it, and looked for alternatives.
2. **China's competitive landscape** - As the second-largest market, it decreased a 14% in the latest quarter. The local rivals have been undercutting Starbucks in price.
3. **Mobile app disappointment** - Mobile orders account for roughly a third of Starbucks’ U.S. orders. This leads to a lot of customers simultaneously waiting for their orders, with overwhelmed baristas tryin",ValueInvesting,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fzs4mo/deep_dive_into_starbucks_optimized_for_choice_not/

I’ve been investing for 3 years, and I’m very passionate about it. This year, I’ve become more serious, and I’m holding a long-term portfolio on IBKR.

**My question is: How should I manage stop losses?**

A real example: I have BABA up by 36%. Does it make sense to set a stop loss, say, around $95 to secure a 20% profit in case it drops by 10% in the future? Or should I at least consider a partial sell order?

I understand the answer is closely related to my investment strategy, which for this portfolio is quite long term—at least 10 years, but I'm curious to learn how should I move from here and apply that to the rest of the positions I hold.

Also, if anyone could enlighten me with some general knowledge, I’d really appreciate it!

# Introduction

>“Empowering Imagination”

The story of Kering begins in 1963, when François Pinault founded a timber trading company called Établissements Pinault. He made several successful acquisitions, and in 1988, the company was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange.

For diversification purposes, the company acquired retail distribution businesses starting in 1990. The transformation into today's Kering began in 1999 with a 42% stake in Gucci. That same year, Yves Saint Laurent and Boucheron were also acquired. Meanwhile, older businesses were divested to focus solely on luxury fashion. In 2001, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen were taken over. After various transformations, Kering has emerged as a pure luxury fashion company.

François-Henri Pinault, not to be confused with his father and founder François Pinault, has been involved with the group since 1987. He became chairman and CEO in 2005. The Pinault family owns 42% of Kering in total. You could say that CEO Pinault has a vested interest in leading this company to success.

The brands under Kering are familiar to many, but **Gucci is the true star.** This company accounts for more than half of Kering's total revenue. Looking at the EBITDA data provided by Kering for each brand, it's clear that Gucci's contribution is even greater. In 2022, over 65% of Kering's operating profit came from Gucci. Other notable brands include Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, and Balenciaga. Kering operates a total of 1700 stores in prime locations where it sells luxury products, as well as through online sales on its own websites.

Looking at the geographical spread of revenue, there's a good distribution. **More than half of Kering's revenue in 2022 came from Western Europe, the U.S., and Canada. The Asia-Pacific region accounted for 33% of revenue.** It's worth noting that China had a disappointing year due to strict COVID-19 lockdowns and mandatory store closures. First-quarter 2023 figures show that the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 40% of revenue, quite different from 2022. This reflects the significant impact of China on the results.

# Kering's management

As mentioned earlier, François-Henri Pinault, the founder's son, is Kering's CEO and director. I still find this combination strange.

The board of directors is important for keeping management aligned with established goals. On the other hand, there's a case for Pinault holding both roles since his family owns 42% of the shares through their family fund Artémis. When a family is so invested in a business, they naturally maintain tight control. It's often a good sign that the family holds a large stake, as management is more likely to think long-term and prioritize success.

Kering's CFO is Jean-Marc Duplaix, who has held the role since 2012. He also served on Puma's board until 2019, where Kering previously had an 86% stake. Since 2018, Kering has significantly reduced its stake in Puma in the aftermath of the shift to luxury. Currently, Kering holds about 4% of Puma.

As Gucci accounts for more than 48% of Kering's total revenue, it's crucial to consider who's in charge of the brand. The CEO is important, but the creative director, ",ValueInvesting,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fqku03/free_kering_fundamental_analysis/
Candid-Persimmon-612,"22nd Century Group: Pioneering the Future of Reduced-Risk Tobacco Products
",1727437101,1fqlmwj,0,1,"In the rapidly changing landscape of the tobacco industry, **22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:** $**XXII)** is emerging as a trailblazer with its innovative approach to smoking alternatives. The company has made headlines with its flagship product, **VLN® cigarettes**, which are distinguished as the world’s first and only combustible cigarettes to receive a **Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP)** designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This landmark achievement positions 22nd Century as a potential leader in a market increasingly focused on reduced harm and safer smoking options.

# VLN® Cigarettes: A Game Changer

VLN® cigarettes are specifically engineered to contain significantly lower levels of nicotine, catering to adult smokers who wish to reduce their nicotine consumption or quit smoking altogether. With a nicotine content that is up to **95% less** than traditional cigarettes, VLN® serves as a groundbreaking alternative that aligns with public health goals aimed at reducing tobacco-related harm. The MRTP designation signifies that the FDA recognizes VLN® as a product that could potentially benefit public health by mitigating the risk of addiction and promoting a safer smoking experience. This endorsement underscores the product's role in a growing movement towards responsible tobacco use.

# A Mission with Purpose

At the heart of 22nd Century Group's strategy is a mission that encapsulates its forward-thinking ethos: ""Our mission is to sell the last cigarette before the 22nd Century."" This tagline not only reflects the company's innovative spirit but also highlights its commitment to transitioning smokers toward reduced-risk products. By concentrating on harm reduction, 22nd Century aligns itself with the global shift towards more responsible tobacco use, a movement that resonates with consumers and public health advocates alike.

# Strategic Positioning for Growth

As regulatory bodies and consumers increasingly seek safer smoking alternatives, 22nd Century Group stands well-positioned for future growth. The focus on products like VLN® not only addresses immediate consumer needs but also responds to broader societal demands for reduced-risk options. Investors looking for companies with a sustainable vision may find 22nd Century appealing, given its commitment to innovation and public health.

In summary, 22nd Century Group's efforts to lead the charge in developing reduced-risk tobacco products signify a crucial shift in the industry. With its MRTP-designated VLN® cigarettes, the company is not just offering an alternative but is actively contributing to the public health dialogue around tobacco use. As it continues to innovate and expand its product offerings, 22nd Century Group is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the tobacco industry, one that prioritizes safety, choice, and responsible consumption.",ValueInvesting,0.2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fqlmwj/22nd_century_group_pioneering_the_future_of/
k_ristovski,Deep dive into Manchester United ($MANU) - Rich Men's Ego Boost,1727440107,1fqmix0,0,21,"**1.0 Introduction**

Back in 2012, Manchester United became a public company, at $14/share. 

Over a decade later with many ups and downs, the share price is **up disappointing 18%**. For comparison, the S&P500 is up **over 300%** during the same period, and the FTSE100 is up a bit **over 40%**.

The club’s financials continue to deteriorate, and I’m sure anyone who supports a sports club has plenty of ideas about what can be done differently.

The goal of this post is to elaborate on why the club is deteriorating (financially) and how I concluded that **sports clubs are billionaires’ toys that serve to boost their egos.**

  
**2.0 How does Manchester United (or any other sports club) make money?**

Sports clubs generally have 3 key revenue sources and here’s what the development of each one looked like for Manchester United over the last decade:

**Commercial**: £303m (vs. £189, a decade ago) - Growth of 4.8% per year

**Broadcasting**: £222m (vs. £136m a decade ago) - Growth of 5% per year

**Matchday**: £137m (vs. £108m a decade ago) - Growth of 2.4% per year



Let’s have a look at each one separately, and in each segment, try to answer the following question: ***How much is this revenue source depending on the fans?***

**2.1 Commercial revenue** consists of:

1. **Sponsorship deals** with various global and regional partners - Such as TeamViewer, the main sponsor on their shirts, but also the ones shown on the advertisement boards around the field.
2. **Merchandising, product licensing, and retail** - Club-branded merchandise, including shirts, training kits, and other apparel. It also covers licensing agreements that allow third parties to produce and sell Manchester United-branded products.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** Absolutely! The link to the merchandising and product licensing/retail segment is quite clear, but the sponsorship deals are also valued based on the exposure given to the companies. The more fans a club has, the more a company is willing to pay for its promotion.



**2.2 Broadcasting revenue** has a comparable growth, averaging **5% per year**. Apart from the revenue share of the matches (Premier League, Champions League, and other competitions), this includes MANU TV, a monthly subscription that generates over £6m per year.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** Not always, as a significant portion of it is split equally, regardless of the club and the number of fans. However, it is dependent on the success of the club and its participation in major competitions.



**2.3** **Matchday revenue** doesn’t need any introduction, although it had surprisingly low growth of \~2% per year, which is lower than the inflation rate.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** - Absolutely!



*Conclusion: All of the 3 revenue sources have very low growth, and are dependent on the two key points:*

* *The competitions the club participates in, and its success in them, and*
* *The number of fans (attending the matches, paying for MUTV, buying apparel, etc.)*

**It is safe to say that over 70% of all the revenue is derived directly from the fans.**

  
**3.0 Key expenses**

Now, let’s have a look at the key expenses and their development over time:

**Employee benefit expenses**: £365m (vs. £215, a decade ago) - Growth of 5.4% per year

**Amortization**: £190m (vs. £55m a decade ago) - Growth of 11.2% per year

**Other operating expenses**: £149m (vs. £88m a decade ago) - Growth of 5.4% per year

  
What you will notice is that **all of them have been growing at a faster pace than the revenue.** The key drivers behind this are the **larger transfer fees** and **higher salaries**. It is worth noting that the recent involvement of the Saudi clubs put even more pressure. Here's some more details of each category, for those who are interested:

**Employee benefit expenses -** The compensation of the players, managers, staff, administration, etc.

**Amortization -** Anytime a player is bought from a",ValueInvesting,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fqmix0/deep_dive_into_manchester_united_manu_rich_mens/

Snoo_41413,Shifting from high-risk trades to long-term value investing,1727456610,1fqsmid,0,1,"This past year has been a rollercoaster. I turned some risky options plays (like TSLA, AAPL, etc.) into over 2500% gains. But after the wild ride, I’ve realized it’s time to move to a more sustainable strategy: value investing.

I started with just $15k in savings from working long hours at fast-food chains, and jumped into trading during the pandemic in March 2020. It’s been a stressful journey, but I’ve managed to build a sizable portfolio. While I did well in high-growth plays, I’m now looking to invest in undervalued companies with strong fundamentals and long-term potential.

I’ve had some big wins with stocks like LUNR (received an early signal) and AMD but lately I’ve been focusing on companies with solid balance sheets, competitive moats, and consistent earnings growth. Stocks like Berkshire Hathaway and Johnson & Johnson have caught my attention for their stability and potential for compounding over time.

I guess I’m finally ready to move away from chasing quick gains and instead, focus on the principles of value investing that emphasize patience and thorough analysis.

>Wells Fargo stock has been a big laggard among major banks in the six years since regulators punished it for creating fake customer accounts by imposing a cap on its assets at about $1.95 trillion.

Now it appears the cap could be lifted in 2025 after Wells Fargo submitted a third-party analysis of its overhaul of risk and control processes to the Federal Reserve, according to a Bloomberg report last Thursday. Wells Fargo stock jumped 5%, to $56.45, that day, and remains near that level. There could be more upside, given an earnings boost that could come with an end to the cap and the bank’s cheap valuation: 11 times this year’s expected earnings of $5.11 a share, 1.4 times tangible book value, and a 2.9% yield.",ValueInvesting,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ftx6k1/wells_fargo_shares_are_undervalued_barrons_stock/

TheDutchInvestors,RyanAir's genius cost-cutting tricks,1728241037,1fxnwou,0,14,"Ryanair is an Irish airline that primarily operates flights within the European continent. The company conducts more than 3,500 flights daily and is the market leader in Europe in terms of passenger numbers. Ryanair's fleet consists almost entirely of Boeing 737 MAX types, with the exception of around twenty Airbus aircraft. By owning only a few aircraft types, Ryanair saves on training and maintenance costs. Additionally, it buys these aircraft in bulk during crises when it has a good bargaining position. Ryanair is known for extreme cost efficiency, with (excluding fuel) nearly 40% lower costs than Wizz Air. This is due to requiring passengers to check in themselves and because Ryanair only flies to second- and third-tier airports. Ryanair is also known for being able to load and unload aircraft extremely quickly, in just 25 minutes. The company has the highest load factor in aircraft compared to all European competitors.

gauravphoenix,Uncommon financial data points I look for ,1728247351,1fxqd1m,0,14,"Beauty lies in finer details, and financial data is no exception. Most of the stock market data platforms such as gurufocus, finbox etc are good at parsing consolidated financial statements (from edgar etc) but completely miss the nuances. They show ""what"" but not ""why"" and ""how"". For example, if there is an increase in long term debt, they won't (and can't) show the reason the debt was raided and ""how"" it was raised i.e. the rate etc (or whether it is convertible debt etc). 

I have a laundry list of questions that make me investigate further to seek the hard-cold facts; I hope you can comment with yours:

1. **D/E vs debt service:** D/E hides the fact the debt might be cheap (e.g. during money printing times such as covid), and I actually like it when companies load up on cheap/free money but use it wisely. A much more helpful metric for me is the % of operating income spent on debt. If the D/E ratio is high, but the company is spending 10-15% of the operating income on debt service, that's within a reason (and likely due to cheap debt). Another reason I don't like D/E is that when companies do crazy buybacks, D/E ratio makes it look like the company is funded by a lot of debt, but that's not always the case in economic sense. 
2. **Non-capex expense**. There is a fetish with capex (and FCF) . Surely one must look at the number carefully but sometimes it is the non-capex number in the cash flow statement that tells you interesting stories and make you investigate more. As I mentioned in one of my previous posts, for some companies to grow (e.g. distributors),  it is not the capex but rather the money spent on M&A that matters. This money shows up as a non-capex number.
3. **Retired stocks vs treasury stock**: While it is true that, generally speaking, buybacks reduce the number of outstanding stocks and increase the treasury stock, the company can re-issue the stocks from their treasury account. Many a time, we over-index on outstanding stocks, but it also important to look at how the company is managing its treasury account. So look for ""Retirement of common stock"" metric on the shareholder equity statement. That tells you the number of stocks that are ""really"" buybacks (i.e. the stocks that cannot be re-issued). Sometimes, companies are not consistent so you might see a line item stating stock repurchases instead of retirement but is important to note the impact on treasury account. The kind of buybacks when the repurchaes are NOT increasing treasury account are more appealing. As an exercise, look at buybacks made by Home Depot and Atkore and contrast the differences. Both companies have spent quite a bit of amount of money (relatively speaking) on buybacks but the impact on treasury accounts is different. 
4. **Forfeitures of restricted shares of common stock**: Look for outliers here- if there is a sudden jump, it either means the company laid off a lot of employees (and their equity is cancelled) or some senior personnel has left the company. The number itself isn't helpful but the reason for change in number is. 
5. ""**other long-term liabilities/assets**"": this number needs attention for big changes. Most of the time, it is derivative accounting that impacts it. If not, it becomes more interesting (are there pending lawsuits?  or warranty issues?) In my experience, most companies use derivates to preserve their debt interest rate and/or foreign currency changes. Depending upon the case, this warrants further investigation. Generally speaking, have a read on how the interest rates will impact the company derivates for interest rate hedge- what you are looking for is the duration of the hedge. If the hedge is going to expire in the near future, and the interest rates are high, it is no bueno. For real-estate companies, this is especially important given the reliance on interest rate swaps to manage their debt. 

Additionally, pension plans and convertible debt items are worth investigating. ",ValueInvesting,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fxqd1m/uncommon_financial_data_points_i_look_for/
Dailystockstrader,"CEO Brian Bonar highlights the benefits of heat pumps and why every American home should have one. With winter approaching, now's the time to explore this sustainable, cost-effective solution.",1728485921,1fztf1u,0,1,"

#OTCQB #DFCO 

# Executive Insight: Every American Home Should Have a Heat Pump, But What’s Taking So Long?

***By Brian Bonar, CEO and Chairman***

Heating and cooling have always been a concern for American homeowners. And now with the cold Winter season rapidly approaching, heating is definitely on the minds of many.

Along with seasonal changes come concerns of efficiency. As the world continues to deal with rising energy costs and an increased focus on reducing carbon emissions, homeowners are increasingly turning to modern options such as heat pumps as a sustainable alternative to [traditional heating systems](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/home-heating-systems).

# Exposing the Unknowns

While heat pumps are rather common and have been in use in regions of the world [such as Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/23/heat-pumps-are-hot-property-in-europe-does-britain-have-cold-feet) for years, questions surrounding them and their benefits persist here in the United States. And, despite several state or community regulations already promoting sustainability and even identifying heat pumps as clean energy solutions—like [New York City’s Local Law 97](https://dalradaclimatetech.com/local-law-97-how-heat-pumps-can-shape-new-york-citys-sustainable-future)—people are asking questions:

***How much do they cost?***  
***How difficult is the installation?***  
***Are they reliable?***  
***Is a heat pump right for where I live?***

Clearly, American homeowners face several challenges when trying to buy and install heat pumps. But why is it so difficult and what’s taking so long to adopt heat pump technology? Below are the reasons why.

MitraMan-Backup,Im dumping my 2050 Fidelity TDF for FXAIX S&P500,1708463552,1avt0yx,0,54,"Man I’m kinda pissed.   I have a TDF for  2050 (26 years away) so I haven’t checked on it in a while.

39 yo head of household w/kids  
Income: AGI for '23 \~ $150k, expect to be > $180k for '24  
  
Current investments:  
  
401k - $425k ($4k after tax, $20k Roth 401k, rest pre-tax)  
HSA - $30k  
529 - $70k  
Brokerage - $65k  
  
Yearly net new investment additions:  
  
401k - max'd out @ $23k, split $14k pretax, $9k roth + company match  
401k after tax - $5k  
HSA - max'd at $8,300  
529 - $10k  
Brokerage - \~ $15k, also there as an emergency fund if needed  
  
401k/HSA/529 low fee large market index funds, brokerage in select stock investments  
  
Mortgage is on track to pay off \~10 years early, and is a low interest 2.6%. Other loan is a car payment that is zero interest. I have tried dilligently to bump up investments any time my income has increased, and am better living within my means than having funds readily available in my pocket to spend.  
  
My goal - Early retirement from my corporate career by 52-55 when the kids are out of college. Find something part time that would be enjoyable and spend the rest of the time traveling. I am not a high luxury person, and expect to get by with less in retirement than I need now (less mortgage, kids, and future college costs). During retirement may or may not keep paid off property, ideally would downsize and reinvest profits from current home.   
  
Questions - is this the ideal strategy and/or what am I missing out on?   
  
I have done enough research to get by, but, due to my income I do not have a heavy Roth strategy as I didn't start investing in it until later in life. I did some research and believe my 401k allows rollover withdrawls which if I undestand backdoor Roth correctly I could pull my after tax out and convert to a Roth IRA. I suspect that might be my next best option to set up and execute. My goal would be to build a sizeable enough investment where I can begin to pull out investment dollars when I am 55, or pull from brokerage account so I can delay my 401k until 59 1/2.   
  
Or, am I misaligning investments since I expect to be in a lower tax bracket at retirement, and should bump my 401k up to be all pre-tax investments, and funnel the rest into post-tax then run the backdoor roth? Then the goal would be to make sure I haev enough between 55 and 59 1/2 to bridge the gap.

Interesting_Gift1756,Most amount of money that can be invested with tax advantage per year?,1722169734,1ee6bsu,0,50,"I am trying to crunch what the most that can be earned tax free a year is and what the most that can be invested.  With things like the tax advantages for write offs of owning homes and not paying income tax on income of sales from homes, what is the most you can tax advantaged save per year?

7k for ira, 14k if married

23k for 401k + employer match  
4k or 8k for hsa  
529 plan which has a 90k cap per child?    
2k per year coverdell per kid

there also might be some that i dont think are available to me like fsa and hra.

There are also state level employees benefits I found like   
  
457b which is like a 401k but for state employees and doesn't overlap with contributions.  So you could have business income and do a self 401k for 23k on the employee side and 25% max of that on employer side so a bit under 6, or more if you get more from the business.  
  
Dependent care spending account 5k?

so if you are married and are a state worker maxing 23k with your 457b + match% and 23k for you and your wife + 6k each, that is over 80k in just 401k contribution for a year.  With everything easily over 100k

I recently stumbled upon an insightful blog post by SG Analytics that dives deep into the US Merger and Acquisition (M&A) outlook for the second half of 2024. As someone interested in business trends and market movements, I found it pretty compelling and thought I’d share some key takeaways with you all.

🔗 [Read the full blog here](https://us.sganalytics.com/blog/us-merger-and-acquisition-2h24-outlook/)

**Key Highlights:**

1. **Economic Recovery and Market Confidence:** The article highlights how the ongoing economic recovery is bolstering market confidence. This optimism is expected to fuel more M&A activities, especially as companies look to expand and innovate.
2. **Sector-Specific Insights:** It’s interesting to see which sectors are leading the charge. Technology, healthcare, and renewable energy are poised for significant M&A action. This aligns with the broader trend of digital transformation and sustainable growth.
3. **Regulatory Landscape:** The blog also touches on the regulatory environment, which is becoming more stringent. Companies need to navigate these complexities to ensure successful deals.
4. **Strategic Moves:** There's a focus on how companies are using M&A as a strategic tool to enhance their competitive edge, streamline operations, and diversify their portfolios.
5. **Challenges Ahead:** While the outlook is generally positive, there are challenges such as inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties that could impact the M&A landscape.

For anyone keen on understanding the dynamics of M&A in the coming months, this blog is a great resource. It provides a well-rounded analysis that’s both informative and engaging.

Have any of you been following the M&A trends? What are your thoughts on the future landscape? Let’s discuss!",investing,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ebp43e/exploring_the_us_ma_landscape_in_2h24_whats_next/
CMVB,ELI5: What is the risk with Index Funds?,1722005620,1ecq2w6,0,1,"I try to educate myself on financial markets to get a feel for where things are going, but I also am humble enough to not expect to outsmart the market - the vast majority of investments are in index funds, my own variation on the '3-Fund Portfolio' concept, and I invest weekly so I'm always averaging in. (I do have some 'splurge' stocks that I bought because I just like the stock, and some stocks from a former employer's ESOP program). 

However, many financial experts are quite sour on index funds, and warn how they can snowball into a spiral if the market starts to seriously go down. It goes without saying that a crashing market is not all sunshine and roses, but no matter how many times I listen to criticisms of index funds, I just don't get the issue. It seems to me that even if this concern is well-founded, it just investors an opportunity to buy into the crash across the board.

Also, until now I used to have 66% SP500 and 33% MSCI Japan (I consider Euro just a copy of the SP500 for worse) (also, my currency is Euro, so perhaps I was doing something wrong there), and switching everything to MSCI World seems to reduce my exposure to Japan from 33% to 8 or so. If japanese economy somehow starts becoming a powerhouse in the world, does the readjustment of the MSCI World mean that I will only have a nice chunk of japanese stocks when the outburst ends? (i.e. I would lose the opportunity) An example of this would be not having a 33% of MSCI Japan at the beginning of this year and missing this spurt of growth

There is talk (always) of a possible correction, led by the tech sector.  I'm retired, so I have a relatively conservative allocation, even though I likely won't need this money (mostly in IRA's) for several years. I'm at 10% cash (emergency fund HYSA + VMFXX), 55% stocks and 35% fixed income. 

I just calculated three scenarios (lo, med, hi) where my stocks respectively would lose 10% / 20% / 30% of their value. Given the weighting of my allocation model, this means:

* in the low scenario, I would be down 5.5% (about the level of $ in absolute terms where I was when 2024 started):

* in the mid scenario down 11% (where I was in Dec. 2023);

* and in the high loss scenario down 16% (same level as June 2023)

DiscoMonkeyz,My company is allowing some staff to buy shares. What do I ask to find out more?,1707124837,1ajchbw,0,56,"My company (private not public) told me today that high-performing staff are being given the option to buy shares in the company.   


The problem I have is that this is being taken out of our bonus, and we have the option to use a fixed percentage of our bonus (25% or 50%) to buy shares.  


On the one hand, I appreciate the ""thanks for your hard work"" offer, but at the same time, this feels like gambling. As far as I know, the company has no plans to go public in the next few years.   


The company is in series B and has so far had 3 rounds of investment since being founded.   


All I knew to ask so far was what happens if I leave. They said they will buy the shares back. Every year they will also have a set period where we can sell them back. So they could technically choose the period in the year when they're at their cheapest I guess. But also since this is a private company, who decides what the shares are worth?  


Please tell me what I need to ask the company to find out more. So far I'm leaning towards a hard ""no thanks"" simply because I don't know enough about the company's financials, or if I get taxed when I sell them back (I'm in Asia), or who controls the price of the shares.

russiancarl,Brokerage that looks like Robin Hood chart but isn't Robin Hood?,1707227761,1akab67,0,1,"I'm having a bit of a tough time with this. I've searched around a bunch and I've seen similar complaints but not any satisfactory conclusion.

I've been with Robin Hood for ages. I use it mostly on the web and my favorite thing is the daily chart right in the middle. It has other issues I don't like, for instance being able to order stocks in lists... can't seem to move them around... and general difficulty finding dividend information in notifications.

So I'd like to switch away from RH yet no brokerage I've used so far has had a daily chart like RH. I have tried Fidelity and Schwab but both add deposits to the chart and are very clunky.

Are there any other decent brokerages that do the daily RH style chart and are reputable? It's hard to tell just from looking at their websites so I thought I'd inquire here for some first hand experience.

I'm not day trading, or options trading, or anything fancy. I'm just small time. I do need a place that does fractional shares. So far I prefer Fidelity for this versus Schwab's limitations.

Should I just stick with RH for my ""fun money"" and keep my major holdings with Fidelity even though its ugly?

One of the big cons with renting vs housing is rent prices will always go up while a 30 year fixed stays the same.

But if SP500 goes up faster than rent, and someone does not want to buy a house, wouldn't it just be good to hold SP500 and withdraw yearly to pay for a years worth of rent?

Ex. 24 years old and life expectancy is 75 = \~50 years left, which is about 600 month. 600 months of rent at 2000/mo = $1,200,000 in a lifetime.

If I had 1.2 million in SP500 RIGHT NOW (hypothetically) (and along with other assets), wouldn't it just be alright to rent forever and withdraw from the 1.2 million gradually over time to pay for the rent?

OperationTestify,Cadeler A/S  - Research Report,1727457827,1fqt3de,0,1,"Friends, family, Mortimer. One guy on Reddit said he was looking forward to read my research. Naturally, I dropped everything and spent a few sleepless nights figuring this one out. I got in trouble with my wife. I neglected my plants. What hardship.

But: I really enjoyed the research on Cadeler. On who? Yes. A company few people know and even fewer can spell correctly.

Cadeler is an owner and operator of vessels (read: boats). It services the massive wind offshore industry. The company installs foundations and turbines, provides O&M services, and calls most of its employees seafarers. How cool.

Cadeler currently has 4 vessels in operation, 7 newbuilds are in the design or construction phase and will be delivered in the next 3 years. The order backlog is huge. And the industry is approaching an even greater undersupply of vessels and support infrastructure, which is good for companies like Cadeler.

I dug even deeper than usual and spent quite some time on finding Cadeler's intrinsic value, whatever that means. At times I felt like I was throwing 200 miles an hour and wanted to buy stocks in myself, but I am not listed.

I find Cadeler is currently fairly priced (oho!), but the stock belongs on every long-term investor's watchlist nonetheless. A wider market valuation reset might be coming, offering a lucrative entry point into an ecosystem that only knows one way: Up.

Candid-Persimmon-612,"22nd Century Group, Inc.: Navigating Market Volatility with Strategic Growth
",1727462964,1fqv282,0,1,"22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: $XXII) has exhibited significant market volatility over the past year, with its stock trading within a **52-week range of $0.24 to $16.00**. This substantial fluctuation reflects the company’s dynamic positioning in the evolving tobacco industry, characterized by innovation and strategic partnerships.

**Market Context**

The range indicates the dramatic shifts in investor sentiment and market conditions impacting 22nd Century. The lower end of the range, at **$0.24**, signals periods of concern, possibly linked to broader market trends or internal challenges. In contrast, the peak at **$16.00** highlights the potential investor enthusiasm around the company’s groundbreaking products and expansion efforts, particularly in reduced-risk tobacco alternatives.

**Innovative Product Offerings**

22nd Century Group has differentiated itself in the tobacco market with its **VLN® cigarettes**, recognized as the only combustible cigarettes authorized by the **U.S. Food and Drug Administration** (FDA) for their reduced nicotine content. Designed to help smokers reduce their nicotine consumption, VLN® cigarettes reflect the company’s commitment to harm reduction, positioning it favorably in a market increasingly focused on public health.

The company’s diverse portfolio, which includes brands such as **Pinnacle**, **Moonlight**, and **Magic**, provides additional avenues for revenue generation. Recent announcements regarding new customer agreements, such as the supply of Moonlight cigarettes to Southeast Asia, indicate a proactive approach to leveraging underutilized assets and expanding market reach.

**Growth Potential and Strategic Partnerships**

The partnership to supply Moonlight cigarettes is expected to boost manufacturing volumes by more than **30%** when fully scaled, underscoring the potential for revenue growth. As 22nd Century explores further opportunities with its various brands, including discussions for reduced nicotine content products under different branding, the company is strategically positioned to capitalize on emerging market trends.

The commitment to innovation and adaptability in the face of market fluctuations is critical as 22nd Century aims to build a sustainable business model. The recent launch of VLN® products in the South Korean market further demonstrates the company’s ambitions for global expansion.

**Conclusion**

The wide **52-week trading range of $0.24 to $16.00** for 22nd Century Group, Inc. reflects both the challenges and opportunities inherent in the tobacco industry today. With its focus on reduced-risk products and strategic growth initiatives, 22nd Century is navigating market volatility with a clear vision for the future. As the company continues to innovate and expand its product offerings, it remains a key player in reshaping the landscape of tobacco consumption, appealing to both health-conscious consumers and investors alike.",ValueInvesting,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fqv282/22nd_century_group_inc_navigating_market/

For starters I should mention there’s no agreed on definitions for any of the styles of investing I mentioned. Some will say value and growth are intertwined and can't be done solely through pricing metrics, others will say they’re polar opposites and the multiples of the company someone invests in tells them everything they need to know.

So, for the sake of convenience I’m going to say:

value investors tend to buy companies with relatively low prices because they believe the market is underestimating the value of future cash flows produced by assets the company currently has and invests in,

growth investors tend to buy companies with relatively high prices because they believe the market is underestimating the value of future cash flows added by assets the company hasn’t invested in yet,

and passive investors tend to buy funds that track broad market indices because they believe the market is efficient so it’s impossible to earn risk adjusted returns better than the market over meaningful periods of time.

To address the value and growth being the same argument I use the returns on Berkshire Hathaway's stock to represent a cerebral style of (value) investing. Aside from that I include portfolios formed by size (market cap), P/B, and P/E that are from Ken French, and returns on the S&P 500, sourced from Aswath Damodaran's website, to represent passive investing.

If you’d like to view or copy the spreadsheet I made to calculate these returns or read more about the methodology I used you can do so [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iyy3LhFUyToYX4r-W-5TD73vlbzmMsfYrWNxeKGo_gc/edit?gid=579886400#gid=579886400).

No not an in depth analysis as I don’t know MUCH about insurance except they are mega powers and isolated to a few big companies..Humana being one of them.

Valueinvestigator,this sub is contradicting value principles.,1727848270,1fu991y,0,206,"
I say this because six months ago, the sentiment in this sub surrounding China was: 

“Don’t touch it with a 10-foot pole.”

“Why would you put your money in a communist country?”

“Population collapse.”

“China is untrustworthy because they cook their financial statements.”

“ADRs.”

You get the idea.

I was a heavy advocate of Chinese stocks over the past six months (look at my comments), and people were shitting on me for the aforementioned reasons. Yet, all of a sudden, when Chinese indexes skyrocketed double digits in the last two weeks, I’ve seen a peculiar rise in interest for Chinese equities.

So why isn’t this sub following the principle of “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful”?

This sub seems to be doing the opposite of this, and most people are just following the popular narrative.

This isn’t me saying “I told you so,” but rather pointing out how this sub isn’t really different from r/investing or any other stock sub. r/valueinvesting should be offering alternative narratives to the popular opinion. We should be critiquing the market’s meta-narratives.",ValueInvesting,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fu991y/this_sub_is_contradicting_value_principles/

username1543213,Classic Cigar Butt- IRES REIT - Irish property investment group,1728252579,1fxsbee,0,1,"Opportunity here for CT a classic Buffet/ graham cigar butt. 

Company is a property investment group in Ireland. Assets are currently worth approx 1.25 billion but the current stock price gives it a market cap of only 475million. 

Now there is a bit of history here. 

Firstly Irish property. Irish property has been on a significant boom recently. Up about 100% in past 10 years. Although also noting here that that’s only basically brought us to the levels we previously had in 2007. Huge dip with the global financial crisis but back up now. 

So is this property boom sustainable? We’ll we had a crash previously so what happened there? Basically we just completely over leveraged, believing prices would go up forever so banks were pushing out 100% mortgages to anyone they could. This isn’t really a problem this time, banks now have very strict regulations on lending. Limits of 4x salary for mortgages and strict deposit requirements. Rent doesn’t have such restrictions, and so in rent than they would in a mortgage. So prices don’t really seem to be a bubble. 

Demand increases are based on huge population increases. Irelands population up 50% in last 30 years. We have a huge pent up demand for more housing. And as with most western countries supply is massively constrained by government regs/priorities. If current trends continue we won’t catch up with demand for about a decade, so we should be in for healthy price increases throughout that period.

There is one major risk to this. Irelands economy is hugely dependent on American multinationals. With a small number of American companies here accounting for 50+% of our gdp. Trump could significantly impact this with a policy to bring these companies back onshore.

PiawNasticc,7 Reasons Why You Should Strongly Consider U.S. Gold Corp. (Nasdaq: $USAU) Today,1728498341,1fzydsh,0,1,"**This $37 Million Market Cap Company Potentially Has $3 Billion Worth of Metal in the Ground** – **U.S. Gold Corp.’s** proven and probable reserve of 1.01 million ounces of gold – plus an additional 250 million pounds of copper – means the company is sitting on potentially over $2.04 Billion worth of gold and $1 Billion worth of copper at today’s prices. Given the speed at which the company is moving ahead to bring some of this gold to market, the window of opportunity to invest at the current lower price may close quickly.

**Bull Market for Gold Sends U.S. Gold Corp.’s Reserve Value Higher** – After retreating in late September, the price of gold has resumed its path higher, moving past $2,000 per ounce. With ongoing inflationary concerns as well as geopolitical instability worldwide, we appear to still be in the early stages of a long-term bull market for gold. This continued high gold price is exceptionally good news for mining companies like **U.S. Gold Corp,** who will continue to see the value of their resources increase.

**U.S. Gold Corp. is Led by One of North America’s Most Experienced Mine Builders** – President & CEO George Bee has taken several mines from development to production at companies like Barrick Gold, Rio Tinto and Anglo American. He leads a team of accomplished explorers and proven company builders at **U.S. Gold Corp.,** who have made and financed the discovery and development of numerous world class gold assets.

**U.S. Gold Corp. Has a Diverse Portfolio off World-Class Projects** – The company’s current mining projects – each in mining-friendly U.S. jurisdictions – offer significant resource potential. The company is moving quickly toward permitting in the first half of 2024 with its CK Gold Project in Wyoming, which will give it a critical advantage over its competitors. And its exploration projects in Nevada and Idaho each offer longer-term upside potential for the company.

**The CK Gold Project Offers Exposure to Compelling Value and Near-Term Production** – The company’s flagship project in southeast Wyoming has been shown to have 1.44 million ounces of proven and probable gold equivalent reserves. This includes 1.01 million ounces of gold and 248 million pounds of copper. Given the current bull markets for gold and copper – plus the company’s anticipation of permitting approval in the first half of 2024 – the CK Gold Project right now appears to be one of North America’s most attractive gold and copper investment opportunities.

**U.S. Gold Corp. Offers Potential for Much-Needed Domestic Copper Supplies** – 30% of **U.S. Gold Corp.’s** revenue currently comes from copper. With new electric vehicles requiring 40 pounds of copper per vehicle – and soaring demand for those vehicles worldwide – the value of the copper resource at the company’s properties has the potential to continue climbing significantly higher. In addition, copper’s elevation to “critical mineral” status in the U.S. means access to government incentives and potential fast-track permitting.

**The Company is Financially Well-Positioned to Move Forward Quickly** – With $4.5 million in cash and zero debt on its balance sheet, U.S. Gold Corp. is in excellent shape to being moving toward opening its mine at the CK Gold Project in Wyoming. At the Wyoming site, all feasibility and environmental studies have already been paid for in previous financing rounds. This means the project has essentially been de-risked and the company is now in great position to move forward once final permitting is achieved.

I'm 29 and recently received an unexpected windfall. It's large, but not extraordinarily large. Let's say it has the potential to be mildly life-changing.

My plan has been to slowly invest a small portion of the money as I learned the basics. About 25% of the money has now been invested. I put the rest in a term deposit to keep it safe from potential delusions of financial wisdom. As you will see, I was probably right to guard against that.

My initial plan for the equity segment was to have 80% in ETFs and the rest in individual stocks. However, my current portfolio is mainly stocks. I quickly found that I enjoyed the process of researching companies and learning how everything worked in a bit more detail. I already had some interest in macroeconomics and I found that having a dollar stake motivated me to look deeper at particular companies and how they were positioned in their sector. That explains the deviation from my initial (wiser) plan. 

This is obviously not a good way to go about investing, but I felt like it was okay to make a few mistakes at the beginning so long as I wasn't being catastrophically stupid. That being said, I think I've reached the point where I need to take a step back before I compound the mistakes. I've arranged to meet with a financial advisor in a few days, but I'm curious to know how you would rate what I have currently. I expect the scale will range from 'somewhat bad' to 'catastrophically stupid'.

The following accounts for 25% of my windfall. Left to my own devices, I'd put most of the remainder into ETFs, bonds, and individual value stocks (which I wouldn't exactly trust myself to pick).

I've been lucky so far, with about 10% returns over 2 months. A lot of that came from the surge in Chinese stocks after the stimulus announcement, though, so it won't last (and hasn't). I think I have less aversion to China than the average American and I think it would be stupid to exclude the world's second biggest economy. That said, I do realize the risks and probably wouldn't want Chinese stocks to make up no more than 10% of my portfolio, much less than the current ratio.

spaddoon,"UK investor – HL , Vanguard or Fidelity?",1708368141,1auux5r,0,1,"Hi all,

I'm a fairly new UK investor and I was wondering what the pros/cons are of Hargreaves Lansdown, Vanguard and Fidelity for someone like me.

I'll be mostly investing in index funds/ETFs.

I've had an account with HL for a couple of years, more for ease than anything else. However, it's increasingly the case that I see funds recommended that aren't available there.

Is Vanguard better for fund availability, and is it worth opening an account with them for wider scope?

I also have an account with Fidelity from way back when. They also seem to offer a wider range of funds, as well as being open to crypto ETFs (this probably isn't the space for that debate, but I admire their flexibility vs Vanguard's stance). However, I'm put off by their trading fees, which seem high.

I'm aware that HL fees can be high, but as I only really deal in index funds and not stocks, and tend to choose funds with lower ongoing fees, that seems to offset the problem.

Or if there's another platform that is better than all three, I'd be keen to hear about it.

Apologies if this question is duplicated elsewhere – happy to just follow a link if so.

Many thanks in advance.",investing,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1auux5r/uk_investor_hl_vanguard_or_fidelity/

dukerustfield,After the Bell: Nvidia clobbers earnings expectations as AI demand hits ‘tipping point’; stock up 6%,1708554344,1awpej3,0,866,"I haven’t seen this posted yet. So excuse me if it becomes a duplicate. But I figured this would be of interest to people because Nvidia has been the poster child for whether or not this is an AI bubble.

I think everyone was taking wait-and-see on their earnings. And the naysayers would be able to point to my expectations as a sign that this is a bubble. 

From MarketWatch :

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-heads-for-biggest-drop-in-over-a-year-and-biggest-market-cap-loss-ever-6c617e9c?mod=djem_mwnafterbell

> Revenue came in at $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion a year before, while analysts had been modeling $20.4 billion.

> Data-center revenue at Nvidia NVDA rocketed more than 400% from a year before to hit $18.4 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $17.06 billion.

> Nvidia forecasts continued strong growth for the ongoing quarter, well above expectations. The company is calling for $24.0 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion a year prior, while analysts were modeling $22.2 billion.

> Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”

> Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share.

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large.

Work for a small company. Recently realized my employer's do not offer a match for 401k (John Hancock). They will, however, contribute annual payments towards the 401k based on profits made from previous year (typically about \~4% of employee's salary).

With no match, should I continue to contribute to the 401k with John Hancock (Target-date fund) or should I roll that over into a traditional IRA and start contributing to that instead? I'd open the traditional IRA with Vanguard or Fidelity and set up a custom portfolio (3 fund?) rather than a target-date fund. I don't have a traditional or Roth IRA open as of right now.

Backstory:

Been investing since I was 14 (when i first got a job). Hit big on a lot of stocks (TSLA pre split, AMZN pre split, PENN from $4 to $100, DKNG IPO, & most recently (50k+ DKNG Options).  Overtime wealth took a huge jump with side hustles (trading cards and ecommerce) before landing my first job.

Overtime - ive liquidated and paid taxes- moved those funds into a Marcus GS high yield at 4.5% which is where the 275 is coming from. 

I currently make 120K full comp.  In investment management & analytics

My IRA is maxed, My employer does NOT match 401k so no point in depositing there, and I earn \~900 in interest income on the 275k (compounded) 

Only debt is a car (lease) - which I am 2 months ahead on payments 

My question is: 

Do i forgo the \~900 a month in interest income and pump that money into the market? ETF/ Mutual Fund combo or hold out for longer on the market deposits?

I do have strong financial literacy and investment knowledge - but thats coupled with a spending issue and being 25 years old with insane amounts of cash.

But back in the late 90’s I invested some money with the same financial advisor my parents used. He has me in some funds that are managed & appear to be giving me returns that are below benchmark- like American Funds & a Columbia Fund. I’m thinking I’d like those just moved to a passive fund like Vanguard or Fidelity. The funds I’m in have an expense ratio of around .45 to 1%. I’m anticipating he is going to talk me out of that tell me that he doesn’t deal in Vanguard. I’m hesitant to drop him - he seems to have done okay by my mom & I think he offers her a lot of all around financial & tax planning - something I’ll need when she passes. I’d also like to be on good terms with him when I inherit $ bc I think I’m going to need his help & things could get a little dicey with my sister. Anyway - any advice for me? I basically want to get out of those funds but not necessarily move the money away from him… yet. If he moves it to Vanguard I think I’m going to have to pay a commission on selling the funds & a commission on buying Vanguard. Maybe I just put it all in the Vanguard total stock market so that I have one commission charge? I’m guessing he will try to sell me on another managed fund with a fee but I don’t see how anything is consistently outperforming passive index funds right?

Some are saying RH is very secure and no concerns at all with having your IRA balance with them. If they were to go under, it might simply get bought out (eg. First Republic) and your balances are insured by the government.  
I've also heard that all RH accounts are margin accounts, which have their own risk. If they were to go under, it would be a lengthy and painful process to recoup your funds...

norcalnatv,Nvidia CEO Elected to National Academy of Engineering,1707591035,1annc6y,0,11,"""Since generative AI exploded into the public consciousness at the end of 2022, demand for Nvidia chips has skyrocketed, leading some analysts to predict the company could hit a two trillion-dollar valuation in the not-too-distant future.  
Nvidia currently has an 80 percent market share of the GPU market and although rivals such as Intel and AMD are trying to chip away at that margin, Nvidia is showing no signs of slowing down.  
Speaking to analysts after the chip company posted its Q3 2024 financial earnings, Huang said: “Nvidia’s GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services and... AI enterprise software are all growth engines in full throttle.”

The NAE claims that election to its academy is “among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer”, with membership awarded to those who have made outstanding contributions to ""engineering research, practice, or education”; pioneered and developed new technology fields; or made major advancements in traditional ones.

xcrowsx,First Solar: My (quick) analysis,1727501617,1fr7dxe,0,14,"**My Investment Thesis:**

A major player in the solar photovoltaic field, with a concentration on large-scale solar projects and a dedication to improving its thin-film solar module technology. FSLR is able to capitalize on its U.S. market presence thanks to favorable policy incentives (Inflation Reduction Act), despite facing hard competition from traditional crystalline silicon technologies. Strong financial position, with a backlog of 75.9 GW in contracts through 2030 and a solid cash position of $1.74 billion. The new R&D innovation center in Ohio and the adoption of its bifacial Series 6 Plus modules place the company in a position for future growth.

Low Price/Forward Earnings and PEG ratios, compared to its 5-year averages. Based on my Fair Price estimate, currently may be undervalued by a significant 51.86%. I believe there is a good opportunity for potential entry, or at least, to add it to your watchlist.

[Quick analysis](https://www.reddit.com/user/xcrowsx/comments/1fr793p/first_solar_my_quick_analysis/) (PNG images). [Download as PDF](https://www.patreon.com/posts/fslr-quick-three-112901170) (3 pages, 1.85MB).

*\*\*\*   \*\*\*   \*\*\**

**Fair Price:**

My Fair Price (Base Case) for **FSLR is $541.45**. The current price of $260.68 is lower by 51.86%.

* Fair-to-Current Price (%): 51.86%
* Current Price/Fair Price: 0.48

I used:

* Discount Rate: 12% *(S&P 500 Next 5-Yr Growth Estimates is 11.90%)*
* Margin of Safety: 30%
* Years: 10
* Future EPS Growth Rate: 20% *(See comments below)*
* Future Dividend and Buyback Yield: 0%
* Total Future Annual Growth Rate: 20 + 0 = 20%

Based on Yahoo Finance and Koyfin data, the next 5-year CAGR forecast is insanely 56%. Why did I take 20%:

* Constant shares outstanding dilution
* I expect an economic slowdown in the next 1-2 years
* High competition landscape

By the way, pay attention that my **forward 5-yr PEG ratio is 1.16**, which is low.

For the Base Case, the Future Expit P/E is 20. 5-year average P/E ratio is 34; I decided to just take the future EPS growth rate which is 20.

As you can see, the stock is undervalued in all cases — Base, Bull, and Bear. This is due to high future growth expectations. In justification of my assessments, I made a DCF valuation (see the Checklist below) and I got $529 which **is very close to my Base Case Fair Price estimate** ($541.45).

**My Checklist:**

**Profitability:**

✅ Gross margin at least 40%: **46%**

✅ Net margin at least 10%: **32%**

**✅** Management (ROIC, ROCE, ROE, ROA): **Yes** *(All above 10%)*

**❌** Piotroski F-Score: **6 of 9** *(Not passed: CFROA > ROA, Higher Current Ratio YoY, Less Shares Outstanding YoY)*

**❌** Revenue surprises in last 7 years: **No** *(Missed all last seven years — Based on TradingView's data)*

**❌** EPS surprises in last 7 years: **No** *(Missed: 2018, 2019, 2020 — Based on TradingView's data)*

**❌** EPS growth YoY last 7 years: **No** *(Declines in 2018 and 2022)*

**Valuation and Advantage:**

✅ Valuation below its 5-yr average: **Yes**

**❌** Does it have a moat: **No**

**Shares:**

✅ Insider ownership at least 5%: **Yes** *(5.34%)*

**❌** Less shares outstanding YoY: **No**

**❌** Insider buys last six months: **No**

**Price:**

✅ 1-year stock price forecast is above 10%: **+13.55%**

✅ Next 5-Yr CAGR is above S&P 500: **Yes** *(56.70% vs 11.90%)*

✅ DCF Value: **$529** *(Highly undervalued by 51%; 10 years, discount rate: 10%, terminal growth: 3%, equity model: FCFE)*

✅ Short Interest below 5%: **Yes** *(4.04%; Data by SeekingAlpha)*

But what I want to do is to invest in one of the large luxury goods companies that had high exposure to China, who have suffered as demand has fallen. Because I think that when China bounces back, so will their profits and share price. I also believe that the current state of the Chinese economy, a general perception that China isn't going to return, is already priced in.

I do have some money in a Chinese ETF, but I feel that I'd rather invest in safer, countries in the west that will benefit. China invades Taiwan, the companies selling goods in China will take a hit, but not be wiped out, like shares in BYD will.

So my current thinking is around Burberry, Estee Lauder and Kering. I think I'm leaning towards Kering as brands like YSL, Gucci and Balenciaga seem stronger, and also, I'm a man and I really don't feel I have any clue about make up, where I get fashion more.

mika_Level_746,What makes your approach unique?,1728287275,1fy2a37,0,15,"
Hey fellow investors, I wondered how your stock analysis differs from others; What makes it unique? I've also noted some key points that are very common, but most of them are less common (I guess) and somewhat may make my approach distinguishable. Thanks !

-Sometimes I head over to past and future analyst estimates, gradings, price targets.
-Deep diving into the historic earnings call transcripts, income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, plus all financial ratios I need.

-Qualitative analysis; Helps me when not knowing a company in the first place. An AI that ran a SWOT to build a foundation for my research.
-Risk factors (Those submitted by the management inside a 10-K); I think they are great resources to assess the management concerns and compare them with your own. Sometimes the provider I use applies a ML-trained risk filter that sorts the arguments by a negativeness sounding so I might even skip basic/generic risks mentioned.
-Segment analysis (Revenue by geographical area, revenue by supply) to identify strengths and weakness.
-Supply analysis for pharmacy industry (Recall, Pre-Market, Clinical Trials and Compliance Costs), but also other industries such as defensive/aero. For example deep diving into government contracts between Lockheed Martin (LMT) and the US government.
-Reviewing critical and open disputes that can result in domino effects. Of course that's highly variable, but see Bayer AG as a valid example.
-Having an employee analysis in place. Surveys about satisfaction & management competence ratings, revenue/employee and talent acquisition statistics (foreign employees via PERM/H1B)
-Board and compensations (separated into all possible award types). For me it's important to have it straightforward from the DEF-13A proxy, because it's audited, same counts for major holders and % institutional holders. Personally, I'd not rely on 13-F and rather on an audited format.
-Tracking past and ongoing M&A deals as part of my research. Assessing the latest 4-S filing with their exhibits in a quantitative way first to get an overview (max. offer, price per unit, dates etc.).
-Sometimes I may also check out lobbying for the past 12M, but I mostly don't consider any of the lobbying insights as pro/con.
-Country risk analysis. That involves reviewing an automated algorithm that combines a total of 23 indicators from Worldbank/OECD/Prof. Damodaran. For me that's a game changer, because I always thought that it's important to see the bigger framework conditions.
-Last but not least I do check the subsidiaries and the relation, company locations and track competitors in a global scope.",ValueInvesting,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fy2a37/what_makes_your_approach_unique/

StartupLifestyle2,ABNB: is the company heading in the right direction?,1728542347,1g0cpui,0,1,"I’ve always been a huge fan of Airbnb: well-managed company with a huge moat that, for a company that depended on people spending nights on their stays, managed to not only survive but also thrive during the pandemic.

**They have the best Free cash flow and revenue ratio among all SP500 companies.**

Over the past 2 years though, I’ve seen many customers complaining about Airbnb regarding price and unreasonable hosts. That really lowers the customer experience. That, combined with the fact that short stays have been scrutinized in many countries introduced a big legal risk. 

Nonetheless, I’ve always found them to be incredible with their product development operations, and regardless of legal risk and complaints, that they would find a way around it just because the company is so well managed.

Recently, Brian Chesky, the CEO, has announced Airbnb will start focusing more on experiences. Many of them being just really unique ones like ‘Stay at Prince’s Purple House’ and ‘Go VIP with Kevin Hart’.

I can’t quite see how this change will truly impact the business: do you think their moat will get bigger? How might that change their business?

mywilliswell95,BIOGEN ($BIIB) a value buy at its 5-year low,1728550407,1g0ef4o,0,2,"Despite being at a 5-year low, I think $BIIB is a great value buy. Current price offers a lot of value opportunity, and with two recent EPS beats, a lot of cash on hand, strong pipeline for new treatments - I think expanding existing drugs and/or launching new ones with strong clinical trial results will turn this around.

Note, investing in Biotech requires time and patience given the lengthy approval processes for products to materialize.

First off, Biogen, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company, which engages in discovering, developing, and delivering therapies for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. They have therapies that treat multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Alzheimer's disease.

**Here's why it's a good value buy:**

* The last two Quarters they had EPS expectations beat. Notably Q2 was a 30% surprise beat. 
* It's profitable, solid cash flows, good balance sheet. They have a relatively low P/E ratio compared to other biotech firms.
* It has a ton of cash - which is a good buffer, going into some market ambiguity I suspect. Additionally, good to have cash for R&D or some acquisitions. 
* As of August 2024, according to Argus Research, the Return on Equity is at 14.4% in August which is up from 8% in March. 
* **I'm optimistic about their new CEO Chris Viehbacher who wants to bring in more early-stage medicines, and focus on diversifying the pipeline beyond core products.** He even said on the last earnings call ""*One of the things I'd like to see us do is really bring a lot more assets in from an early stage because the earlier you can acquire these assets, the more shareholder value you can create.*""
* 2023 they were focused on cost-cutting so, those cycles tend to take a year or so to feel the effect on the balance sheet. 
* They have some dividend potential, and with a strong cash position they could allow for dividends in the future or share buybacks. 

  
**Playing Devil's advocate I would say the following could compromise the value**:

* Overreliance on core products and not expanding fast enough by bringing in more early-stage medicines. If the Alzheimer's treatment (Leqembi) suffers any setbacks in expanding, then that would hit them pretty hard. In general, they have some concentration risk.
* The failed launch of another Alzheimer's treatment called 'Aduhelm' led to some declining revenues, bad blood with the FDA, upset customers and of course frustrated shareholders. The former CEO Michel Vounatsos stepped down after so, therefore I hope the new CEO can inspire building back those relationships.
* Aduhelm was a massive commercial failure, that had a crazy high cost, was limited in its coverage by Medicare, and sparked a lot of ethical concerns regarding the FDAs drug approval process. So BIOGEN needs to really focus on making sure this doesn't happen again.

tl;dr

Biogen is a large, established player in the biotech space with strong fundamentals, and while it faces near-term challenges, its cash position, future pipeline, and cost discipline offer a compelling long-term investment case. It's undervalued by at least $50 from it's current price ($185.76) - could be an 50% upside from here.

dubov,AmBev - Latin American Drinks Giant,1727515428,1frai59,0,16,"This is one of my picks in the 'value/quality' category.

It has strong and enduring margins, like most drinks companies. 16% ROIC, and the ROE is the same because they have no debt. Good dividend yield. Openness to buybacks in future.

Drinks companies often trade at multiples like 30x because they are are high quality. AmBev used to trade around 20-25x (somewhat lower than usual, probably due to being in an emerging market). It has fallen out of favour lately and now trades at around 13x.

The main issue has been growth. Revenues have been mostly flat for at least 7 years. But, the green shoots of growth are now there. See slide 11 volume growth in latest earnings presentation

https://ri.ambev.com.br/en/news/

Another issue has been Argentina's currency devaluation. And the Brazilian government has increased taxes. But this news is priced in at this point. 

I am optimistic about future earnings growth, which considering its other attributes, makes it an absolute steal at this price.

Also, anecdotally, I used to work for ABInBev, the parent company. We had managers from AmBev, and I can tell you that these guys do run the company as a shareholder would like it to be run (even though I wasn't so appreciative as an employee!)

Icy-Earth-2953,Here are some financial analyses of Nvidia from analysts,1727523354,1frcbfw,0,1,"Predictions for Nvidia's stock price in 2024 include a series of forecasts from top market experts. Most analysts predict that, despite the company's market value recently decreasing by $280 billion, NVDA's stock price will reach between $114.52 and $139.01. More pessimistic forecasts suggest that by the end of this year, the company's stock price may moderately decline to between $82.17 and $96.47. Analysts at CoinCodex do not rule out the possibility of the stock price falling to $70.53.

Analysts expect that by 2025, Nvidia's stock price will reach between $156.90 and $185.40 per share. More optimistic forecasts indicate that the stock price could rise to between $214.93 and $220.77. Conversely, more conservative estimates suggest that NVDA's stock price will grow moderately, reaching $146.40 per share by 2025.

shillyshally,Matt Levine (Bloomberg) on the upcoming reddit IPO,1708557145,1awqkqx,0,30,"Matt Levine is alway funny and interesting and he hits on all the pluses and the many minuses regarding the reddit IPO and the supposed offer to some redditors. The thing about reddit is that it is just that, reddit. There isn't much of a moat, just ask the Digg guys how that went.


I guess there are three ways to look at this:

Reddit plans to place a big chunk of its IPO shares in the hands of its users, an unusual move that could build loyalty but also comes with risk. 

The company plans to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, according to people familiar with the matter. The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors. 

Ideally for the company and its underwriters, Reddit shares will rise in their stock-market debut, bestowing big gains on those who buy in at the IPO price. If the stock falls, however, it could anger those members of Reddit’s community — a group that, broadly speaking, hasn’t shied away from boycotts in the past.

Banks generally favor selling the bulk of an IPO to big money managers that tend to hold stocks for a relatively long time. Individual investors are viewed as more fickle and prone to selling at the first sign of weakness.

One is the sort of philosophical view. Reddit Inc., more so even than most social media companies, is a publisher that doesn’t pay its writers and editors. It runs a website that publishes huge amounts of content on various message boards; the boards are mostly moderated by volunteers and the content is written by users. From this, Reddit generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue from ads and data. For the most part, the users do not really share in that revenue.

This model works fine — It is in fact the case that the users happily post and moderate on Reddit without getting paid! There is no need to pay them! — but it is awkward, particularly when an initial public offering is set to value the company at more than $5 billion. “We created $5 billion of value and get none of it,” some redditors will probably complain. Letting them buy stock at the IPO price doesn’t really address that complaint — they still have to pay for it! — but it sort of symbolically responds to it. “We let our users share in our success, by paying full price for the stock,” Reddit can say; it’s fine, whatever.[1]

The second is the conventional capital markets view. Here, the rough idea is that banks sell the stock in an IPO mostly to big institutional investors, most of whom they expect to buy and hold the stock. Then the next day, the stock opens for trading, and lots of people — institutions that didn’t get allocations, but also retail investors — want to buy it. But there’s not a lot for sale, because most of the IPO was placed with long-term holders. So there’s a lot of demand and not much supply, so the stock goes up, creating an “IPO pop.” This means that it is generally good to get an allocation in the IPO: You buy stock in the IPO, and the next day it reasonably predictably goes up and you make money. And retail investors mostly don’t get to buy a lot of stock in IPOs, so they miss out on this pop.

Letting individual redditors buy stock in the IPO sort of addresses this problem: The redditors get to buy stock at the institutional price, and then it goes up and they make money. On the other hand, if you let the retail investors buy in the IPO, that kind of ruins the mechanism that leads to the IPO pop? The devoted retail investors who want to buy the stock do so in the IPO, rather than having to wait until the next day, so there’s not as much demand when the stock opens for trading. And a lot of those retail investors might be looking to make a quick buck by flipping the stock, so there is more supply. So there’s less reason to expect a pop. “If everyone buy",investing,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awqkqx/matt_levine_bloomberg_on_the_upcoming_reddit_ipo/

Traditional: 6% match, ($344 + $344 match per month), $100 more per month in paychecks

Roth 401K: 6% match, ($444 + $444 match per month), $100 less per month in paychecks


I also have a Roth IRA which I have not maxed out this year yet. I am thinking I do the traditional 401K until I max out my Roth IRA, then switch to Roth 401k once that Roth IRA is maxed out. 

OR do what I said above and then KEEP it at traditional 401k and use the extra $100/mo to invest in my other individual accounts

It feels like the financial institutions and regulators are deliberately trying to avoid working with crypto. They claim to be protecting us from fraud, but it seems more like a tactic to suppress those of us who are trying to break free from traditional financial systems.

The companies that have contributed 75% or more to Democrats (including the executives) have been outperforming the entire market for over 3 years.

Is it because Democratic executives are better at running companies? 

Or because there’s a Democrat in office that’s somehow helping Dem companies?

Or is it because there are less holdings (40-60 is better than 500)?

Or is it just random coincidence? Thoughts?

I think movie theaters serve a function and having an air conditioned space where you can go has always made sense to me. It’s a relatively safe family environment and it’s good for people with kids. families spend money on their kids like single people spend money on their dogs or cats. 

But I think I’m bias and AMC is doomed but I want to believe it’s not. My question is more about how people here feel about AMC and the debate of will movie theaters always exist. Are there any futurists that have a prediction and what is that prediction. No wrong answers. Ultimately, if theatres will in fact exist then will AMC stock be worth anything.

1) Can I get rich from small amount of shares?

So Far I'm going to put in 50 bucks a year into Amazon but soon when my income grows to 100k I will put $200 a year. And I'm going to hold it for like 30+ years. Is there a good chance that I can get to 100k or 1 Million dollar from this strategy? If Amazon stays on top 

2) Stock vs Sp500

So when a business reach there expected earnings for the year does that mean that they beat the Sp500 or match it?

Like is the only way they will underperformed the Sp500 is if they fail there expected earnings?

3) Should I care about Stock share prices?

Like I'm confused on why Costco ($800) and ulta beauty ($400) cost so much while apple, Nvidia, Google and Amazon are like $200 to $150

Like those 4 overall makes more money than Ulta & Costo so why are they less? 

Is it because they are younger?

Also should I care about a stock share costing so much. To be honest Costco is a great business but since there share is so much it kind of scares me to invest in it.

4) So since I'm taking a 1% Risk would it be the best idea to do the risk on my Roth Ira & HSA since it is a tax advantage account?

Holiday_Treacle6350,LGCY - Legacy Education Corp. DD,1727885059,1fujtdy,0,1,"Market Cap: 53 M

# Story:

This is a company that runs three colleges. *High Desert Medical College*, *Central Coast College*, *Integrity College of Health*. Note that properties are not owned, but leased. You can read up more on [these colleges](https://www.niche.com/colleges/high-desert-medical-college/), their reviews, and the programs they offer (mostly related to medicine & nursing).

In the future, they aim to acquire more institutions, add more programs to current colleges (such as dentistry), and launch brand new campuses. So the scope for growth is definitely there. Currently, 36% of their new student enrolments come from referrals by existing students. And YoY **enrolment is up by 28%** from 1705 students in 2023 to 2187 students in June, 2024. Retention rate is 86%.

So with marketing programs, acquisitions, new programs, increasing enrolment through referrals, increase in education prices YoY - I see an increase in top line revenue.

# Undervalued?

With a price of **53 M**, we have **10 M** in net cash left after paying all liabilities. So the underlying business is 43 M, with revenues of 46 M (30% yoy increase) and a net income of 5.1 M (88% yoy increase). For more information on expenses, please see page 69 of the [10K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm).   
  
So a PE ratio of **8.4** for a business that's clearly growing quite fast and has lots of opportunities for future growth. With no debt and 10 M in excess cash. 

# Concerns

I don't think I'm qualified enough to fully understand the repercussions of the stock based compensation they are handing out. CEO is making 1 M a year (including stock) on a business that's making 5 M. Glancing through the 10K I believe there is a good chance of dilution in the future (Page 80). They can issue 2M new shares. And a 5% increase in the number of shares every year if they want to.   
  
I might be wrong about this risk though. Maybe it's not that big a deal. Other than that the business looks solid in the sense that it makes money, has a proven standard model, and is hard to displace because of the regulations in place and the infra and staff required. That is to say, I don't see many competitors coming in and taking their business away.",ValueInvesting,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fujtdy/lgcy_legacy_education_corp_dd/

Candid-Persimmon-612,"U.S. Gold Corp: Pioneering Gold Exploration in the United States
",1728301995,1fy5qp5,0,8,"U.S. Gold Corp($USAU) is an emerging leader in gold exploration and development, with a strong focus on properties across the United States. The company is committed to identifying and advancing high-potential gold projects that promise significant returns for its investors. With a diverse portfolio that includes key exploration properties such as the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, Maggie Creek in Nevada, and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho, U.S. Gold Corp is strategically positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for gold as a safe-haven asset.



CK Gold Project: A Jewel in the Heart of Wyoming

The CK Gold Project is a cornerstone of U.S. Gold Corp's operations, located in Southeast Wyoming. This project has garnered attention due to its promising geological attributes and potential for high-grade gold deposits. U.S. Gold Corp is actively conducting exploration and development activities to assess the project’s full potential. The CK Gold Project’s strategic location in a historically productive mining region further enhances its viability, making it a prime candidate for future development.



Maggie Creek: Tapping into Nevada’s Rich Gold Trends

In addition to the CK Gold Project, U.S. Gold Corp holds exploration properties at Maggie Creek, situated within the renowned Cortez and Carlin Trends of Nevada. This area is known for its rich gold deposits and has produced significant quantities of gold over the years. The Maggie Creek properties are part of a broader strategy to tap into the existing infrastructure and mining expertise in Nevada, where the regulatory environment is favorable for mining operations. U.S. Gold Corp’s exploration efforts in this region aim to identify and delineate new gold resources that can be developed to meet increasing market demands.



Challis Gold Project: Exploring Idaho’s Potential

Another promising asset in U.S. Gold Corp’s portfolio is the Challis Gold Project, located in Idaho. This project is strategically positioned in an area with a rich history of mining and exploration, providing the company with an excellent opportunity to discover and develop new gold resources. The Challis Gold Project exemplifies U.S. Gold Corp's commitment to exploring under-explored regions with significant potential for discovery.



Conclusion: Driving Forward with Exploration and Development

U.S. Gold Corp is dedicated to enhancing its gold exploration portfolio while maintaining a keen focus on sustainable practices and community engagement. The company's strategic approach to exploration across its diverse properties not only positions it to benefit from the growing global demand for gold but also enhances its potential for long-term growth and profitability. As it continues to advance its projects, U.S. Gold Corp remains committed to delivering value to its shareholders and contributing to the U.S. mining industry.



Other Tickers to Watch

**Oakmark on Nasdaq**

Nasdaq is a global technology company that provides platforms and services for capital markets and other industries. Over the past decade, under the leadership of CEO Adena Friedman, Nasdaq has transformed from a traditional equity exchange into a collection of fast-growing, high-quality software and data businesses with the majority of revenue coming from non-exchange segments. Nasdaq’s recent acquisition of Adenza led some investors to question management’s capital allocation discipline. However, we believe the subsequent share price reaction more than compensates for the risk that Nasdaq overpaid for Adenza. More importantly, the experience seems to have catalyzed a renewed focus on organic growth, debt paydown, and capital return. Despite Nasdaq’s potential for faster than average growth, high mix of recurring revenue, and impressive operating margins, the stock trades at a P/E multiple in line with the broader market. We were pleased to purchase shares in this excellent business for an average price.

**VGI Partners on London Stock Exchange Group**

The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has transformed from a traditional exchange into a Data and Analytics group. Today it only generates 3% of revenue from its legacy cash equities exchange. In doing so, it has transitioned into a business with an attractive recurring revenue profile and an opportunity to cross-sell data and analytics services on the back of its large acquisition of Refinitiv in 2021. Since then, LSEG has invested behind Refinitiv, which has led to revenue growth acceleration.

We think LSEG is now at an inflection point, not only to continue improving revenue growth but also to benefit from margin improvement after a heavy investment period. This period has seen LSEG incur additional spending from the integration of the Refinitiv assets, as well as form a large partnership with Microsoft. We expect LSEG to elaborate further on this strategy at its investor day later in 2023 and to introduce new medium-term financial targets.

We find the valuation highly compelling for this quality of asset. LSEG is trading at a discount to nearly all of its Data & Analytics peers, despite a more attractive growth profile over the next three years. Additionally, the original Refinitiv vendors have been selling down their large stake, steadily reducing the valuation overhang. As this continues, we believe it will close the valuation gap with peers.

**Platinium AM on London Stock Exchange**

Thanks to its unique mix of businesses – a combination of data and trading platforms – LSEG has created a virtuous cycle business model. Its customers rely on its data platforms – and increasingly on AI-driven quantitative analysis – to underpin their trading decisions in equity, foreign exchange and fixed income markets. They then trade those assets on LSEG trading platforms - creating ever more valuable data. Then pay for that data to drive their next sequence of trading decisions. It’s an incredibly powerful business model and it underpins our belief that LSEG can grow revenue consistently year on year. We were able to buy into LSEG at a discount when the company was swallowing the Refinitiv acquisition. Our view was that the deal would transform LSEG into a leading global financial data provider – however the rest of the market didn’t see this potential. Today, the company has many vectors for growth and is market-leader in many of its segments. We see the Microsoft partnership as a very exciting call option that could accelerate its growth, yet that potential isn’t yet built into the share price. LSEG is held in Platinum’s International and European Funds and in the Platinum Global (Long Only) Fund.

Electronic_Debt_8523,"U.S. Gold Corp. ($USAU): Navigating the Bull Market for Gold
",1728570043,1g0jxpo,0,1,"The steady rise in gold prices over the past two years has created significant opportunities for investors, with many experts predicting that the bull market for gold will continue into 2025. Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank, recently forecasted that gold prices could hit $3,000 per ounce in 2025 after accurately predicting that prices would exceed $2,450 earlier in the year. This is promising news for gold investors, particularly gold mining companies that stand to benefit from increased margins and expanded operations.



One company well-positioned to take advantage of this bull market is U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU). In a recent interview conducted by Ty Hoffer, president of Winning Media, Luke Norman, Chairman and Co-Founder of U.S. Gold Corp., discussed the company’s outlook amid rising gold prices, its portfolio of assets, and its unique advantages in the current market environment.



Rising Gold Prices and the Bull Market

When asked whether the gold bull market would continue into 2025, Norman expressed confidence, noting that this is the “long-awaited bull-cycle in gold.” He believes the inflation-weighted gold price will be significantly higher than $2,600 USD/oz, despite the challenges that come with market corrections. This ongoing bull market, Norman explained, presents a lucrative opportunity for gold mining companies and investors alike.



Gold Mining Equities: Undervalued and Ready for Growth

Norman emphasized that gold mining equities remain undervalued, even after the historic run in gold prices. He pointed out that with energy costs remaining largely stagnant, profit margins for gold producers are skyrocketing. Additionally, producers are actively seeking ""replacement"" ounces for their diminishing reserves, fueling interest in developers and explorers like U.S. Gold Corp. As the gold cycle progresses, Norman expects capital inflows from general investors and gold funds, leading to a significant revaluation of mining equities.



Why U.S. Gold Corp is Uniquely Positioned for Growth

Norman highlighted several reasons why U.S. Gold Corp is better positioned for growth than its peers:



Shovel-Ready Projects: The CK Gold Project in Wyoming is one of the only permitted, shovel-ready gold and copper projects in North America, attracting potential M&A interest as producers seek to replenish dwindling resources.



Prime Jurisdiction: The CK Gold Project is located on state-owned land in Wyoming, one of the safest and most mining-friendly jurisdictions in the world. The absence of federal regulations greatly expedited the permitting process and continues to benefit ongoing development.



Strong Exchange Listing: U.S. Gold Corp's NASDAQ listing gives it unique access to both retail and institutional investors, particularly with its tight share structure. This positions the company to fully capitalize on the gold bull market.



Copper Diversification: U.S. Gold’s copper resources offer a hedge for investors who may not be as bullish on gold, providing diversification within the company's asset portfolio.



Catalysts for Share Price Growth

Analysts at HC Wainwright & Co. and Alliance Global Partners have set a price target of over $13 per share for USAU, which has recently hovered between $5 and $6. Norman believes the key catalyst for closing this gap is the expected inflow of capital into the sector as the gold bull cycle becomes more widely recognized by generalist investors. This, combined with continued value creation at CK and other assets, could propel U.S. Gold Corp toward its historical highs.



In summary, U.S. Gold Corp is well-positioned to benefit from the rising gold prices and ongoing bull market, making it an attractive opportunity for investors seeking exposure to gold and copper assets in a supportive regulatory environment. With key projects like CK Gold ready to move forward and favorable market conditions, the company is poised for continued growth.

The company has achieved impressive financial performance, with net income margins over 60% and EPS growth of 30% year-on-year. Despite recent market underperformance, it still seems a strong buy due to its robust financials and market-leading position. The stock is currently undervalued by about 25%, with an intrinsic value of $131.06 compared to a market price of $98.58. Evolution's strategic expansions, including new studios and acquisitions, further bolster its growth potential.

The only potential reasoning behind the market underperformance would be the ongoing Georgia strikes. This could disrupt operations, especially since more than half of Evolution's workforce is based in Georgia. However, this appears to be a short term obstacle.

If they're not in an index, that makes them even more lovable.”  On it’s surface this makes sense when it comes to finding an edge, stocks that currently do not have a lot of interest may have a better chance of being misvalued than a company that has 200 analysts covering it and cnbc talking about it everyday.  

I also enjoy burning the midnight oil and finding companies that do not have a lot of interest around them and starting positions. Recently I initiated positions in Materialize NV $MTLS, Taboola $TBLA and Auna SA $AUNA.  I have been serious considering starting a position in Icon Energy $ICON, A Greek company that recently declared a dividend. All these stocks typically trade with fairly low volume, but I feel like they can present the best opportunities for a value investor.

No-Buy-8927,Chinese bullmarket,1727891508,1fumgg1,0,15,"Hello fellow investors,

I have been heavily investing in Chinese companies for the last couple of years.
Mainly for the reason that I did not share the markets assessment of geopolitical and economic risk associated with China. Therefore my plan was to accumulate and let the fundamentals improve over time and hope that someday market conditions change in a positive way.
I am sure that there are still actual value investors left in this sub and maybe even some which share my view on Chinese equities. 
My positions have gained quite a lot in recent weeks due to the comprehensive actions taken by the Chinese government and I understand that this will have a positive effect on the economy and also on the Chinese financial markets as history has shown. With higher investments and stronger consumption fundamentals will improve as well.
My concern is, that fundamentals will definitely not improve the same pace as the prices have in recent days and weeks. So I’m thinking about rebalancing a little and cash in on some gains. I guess you could say I am quite fearful since the market got greedy.

Understand that no one here is giving me official advice I'm just gonna lay out my logic and would appreciate some guidance or other things to consider before potentially abandoning the idea completely or taking the next official step and setting up a consultation (either tradersaccounting or greeentrader, any others you suggest?).

Quick rundown, I have a normal day job w/access to health insurance and a 401k and also fund a roth IRA. I use IBKR and about 85% of my trading (about 3-4 round trips/month) is futures trades with the other 15% being options and etfs. 

So I DO NOT qualify anywhere near the 720 trades a year to make it to TTS status and if I understand that is the ONLY way I could look at writing off various legitimate trading expenses (home office, internet, etc.). 

I do beleive however if I do some sort of business for trading I may be able to get access to other retirement accounts (sep IRa, solo401k?) that I may be able to shuttle more tax advantaged money tothus shortening my retirement timeline (not getting around minimum age but hope to be more ""ready"" by then). I don't know what other things could actually be considered a write off, you hear the joke about talking about ""business"" over lunch it has now become a tax write-off, not looking to do anything not legitimate but seems there are some advantages out there the average person can't do not owning a business. 

So far the main drawbacks I have seen from my research is potentially paying professional data fees (I use IBKR).

Im relatively young (late 20s), dont have much debt, and have a networth of about 1M, relatively high tax bracket (earn \~250k annually in a HCOL state).  
  
I'm fine with investing about 50K tops of that into VTSAX (I already have about 100k in VTSAX). Nothing more into anything risky since I'm super risk averse.  
  
I'm looking at a few options for the remaining 150K.  
  
I've been looking at PopularDirect's 5 year CD offering 4.45 APY.  
  
I know CD's are frowned upon, but it seems its been ages since any long term CD's are oferring anything close to mid to high 4s, so I feel like this might be a good time to lock in a relatively high fixed rate.  
  
I'm also open to Treasury notes (ie 2yr, 3yr, 5yr etc). They seem to be yielding in the mid 4's, and given they are state tax exempt are they actually an even better deal than the Popular direct 5yrs CD's ?

HailtotheThief03,Am I on the right track with investments? ,1708573103,1awwhhr,0,1,"Trying to figure out if I’m in a good place for my age (30 years old). I think I’d like to retire at 55-60 years old. I currently do not have any debt(no car payment, I always pay my cc each month, student loans paid for, and no mortgage). I do not own, I rent. It’s expensive where I am and at this point I don’t have a 20% down payment for a home - plus the homes where I live are just beyond outrageous. I think I’m fine renting for awhile. 

I am contributing 10% of my income to my 401K. Currently around 70K in there. I obviously didn’t always contribute that much but I’ve made more money over the years as I’ve moved up with my company.  They match 6%. I am considering bumping this up even more - probably 15 percent which is still a little below max contribution but my commission can vary so I want to be cautious. I also am almost making too much money for a Roth IRA. 

I am a part of an Employee stock purchase plan which offers stock at a discount and have been contributing 5% of my paycheck for the last almost 7 years. I also have received RSUs each year and am receiving even more per year with a promotion. So total value of this is 71K with a potential value of 18K that hasn’t vested yet - and more RSUs to come each year. 

A few years ago I started a health savings account. Currently only putting in what my company matches which is $750. So that’s 1500 a year. I’ve not invested any of this but am considering it. I have about 5K in there. 

After just staring at my dividends and unsure what to do with them (probably should have reinvested but whatever 🫠) I decided to use them to buy 6 shares of the ETF ITOT. I’m going to start off with 100 bucks a month into this but want to see how increasing my 401K contributions plays out financially first. The ETF world is a little new to me. Just starting out. A lot of my 401K is invested in vanguard so I figured it would be good to do an ETF that wasn’t vanguard for diversification reasons? This could be inaccurate thinking so open to feedback here. 

I’ve been saving since I got my job 7 years ago. I use to make much less so it’s been an up hill climb. But I have 26 grand in savings which I feel is a little disappointing. I have also just never really heard of a High Yield Savings account until recently so I just moved everything over and started saving in that account last year. I was putting around 250 a paycheck in there for around 6 years (having to dip in occasionally for unexpected vet or car bills for example). If my commission checks were a lot and I had left over pay I’d just send it over to the savings account. I now put around 600-1000 a month in the savings account depending on commission checks. I know it will grow faster because my contribution amount has increased recently but idk not feeling great about it. 

But anyways - is this a good place to be financially? Any advice at all? I’m always over fixating and worrying I’m not doing enough.  ",investing,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awwhhr/am_i_on_the_right_track_with_investments/

Kyle-SMMA,Best asset management business to hold?,1708291657,1au5dut,0,4,"I’m in a bit of a predicament. I’m currently trying to decide between the 3 powerhouses to which are:

Blackrock
Blackstone
Berkshire Hathaway 

Yes I do own a world index but I want to get a bit of exposure to asset management companies so my question is, in your eyes which one is the best long term investment?

I know blackrock make their money off of fees associated with holding their ETFs.
I know Blackstone make their money off of private equity and also actively manage funds and if I’m not mistaken, they own a lot of real estate.
Berkshire make their money off of dividends and profits from their investments and companies they actually own.

Did I miss anything else?

So once again, my question is what makes the most sense to invest into as I hear Berkshire being recommended a lot and the other 2 not so much. Is there a reason why or is it all down to preference?

Brokerage - Stocks

asking from a tax view in case I am missing something.   
HYSA you pay interest which is at income rate.   
Brokerage you pay short term on dividends and long term if you sell it after a year  


does that mean it would make sense to put most of the stock in brokerage and most of the cash in Roth assuming you can access Roth because of age

I've never used Fidelity and don't know much about it.  My current portfolio is in a TDF and it looks like that will be maintained according to the paperwork.  Does this sound right?  Do I need to be aware of anything else that might not be clear from the documentation?

DrummerFantasti,Why the ultra rich rent their homes,1721784507,1eap2bb,0,1,"Simply state: the renting yield does not scale in proportion to the property value after a certain threshold.

Buying a 400k home may make sense if you can get close to 1% yield per month. But buying 20M home will only net you 3-4% yield **per year**. 

Sitting on a 20M house and paying off a 30 year mortgage doesn't make sense as your money don't work during the entire period of repayment.

20M on the S&P will net you 2.1m on average per year. Paying off the rent will still net you a healthy amount of profits.

The opportunity cost of **not** renting is very high in this sense. They are actually foregoing alot of upside by owning expensive properties

Sooo, this isn’t about nvidia and its “balloon” but you can read it like that if you want. To me, this highlights China. 

There has been so much ink spread on chinas market and, as of about yesterday, you’re talking about one nvidia worth of value. And while that’s a lot and a lot to talk about, it’s not so much in the context of an American competitor whose financial woes are said to imperil us. 

I was quite surprised to learn its size and putting it into context. Yes, many markets are smaller than one nvidia or one Germany or one France with a side of Monaco. But we’re not being bombarded with news that those other markets are going to cripple us. If nvidia tanks today, it might hurt, but it would hardly be catastrophic 

> With one going up and the other down, Nvidia is now worth as much as the entire Chinese stock market, represented by the H shares of the Hong Kong stock market.

> That’s a point made by Michael Hartnett, Bank of America strategist, who also notes that the $600 billion market cap rise in Nvidia NVDA, 2.78% over just the last two months equals the entire market cap of Tesla TSLA, 1.02%.

f00dl3,So I showed my wife errors of Edward Jones,1707598249,1anq2hr,0,1,"So I was able to show my wife the error of Edward Jones and areas where they are obviously putting the ""advisor's"" interest ahead of her own. Cool. She's now open to finding another advisor and trying something new out. 

&#x200B;

So now where do we go? I checked into Fidelity as they have branches around here, and their products from a DIY perspective which I have been doing are amazing - for people like her who don't understand what stocks are, they have target date funds and robo advisor programs - but she does want someone she can talk to in person and that's a big thing for her. They seem to have a minimum cash requirement which we are not at for their Wealth Management (500k) - and they may offer other services from what I have heard if you have 50k or more, but the reviews for local offices here are horrible - 1.5 to 2/5 stars on Google. So maybe Fidelity may be just as bad if not worse than Edward Jones from a ""advisor"" stance.

&#x200B;

Definitely one someone who is a fiduciary. But the question is at that point how that works - because if they are independent kind of like CPAs/etc... then how would some random Fiduciary manage the ""keys"" to my wife's 401K plans and IRAs? Would I have to link accounts up and/or give them access to trade on her behalf, or would they basically tell her / us what we should do in terms of investing the money? I'm confused how this would work if the assets are not at the same place as the advisor.

&#x200B;

My biggest fear and I don't want to say this in the wrong way - but since we are DINKs and we won't have kids, that when we get old, our mental health may start to go out like POTUS style. If that happens, we may have a lot of money I would have forgotten how to manage at that age and/or fall victim to scams like many older people do. It's great being young and eager to save fees and DIY right now, but I mean I'm 38. 30 years from now I could have onsets of dementia. 

&#x200B;

I would want to chose an advisor who is at the same place as all of our money. Right now most of our money is at Fidelity. And honestly I like Fidelity and their platform. Especially since Vanguard and some others outright ban trading crypto related funds, and frankly right now I am doing quite a bit of trading with BITO right now... so while I do think crypto is largely a scam, I don't support shutting that door.",investing,0.45,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1anq2hr/so_i_showed_my_wife_errors_of_edward_jones/

dubov,China small cap pick - 3658 New Hope Service Holdings,1728319857,1fycflv,0,1,"While a lot of the big names in China/Hong Kong have been ripping, there is still plenty of value in the mid and small cap  market.

Based in Chengdu, New Hope Services provide property management services to clients primarily in the East and Southwestern areas of China. They are an offshoot of the New Hope Group, who are a real estate developer (among other things).

Their financials are outstanding:

- 17% net margin, 33% gross margin
- Clean balance sheet
- 19% ROE/ROIC

""Oh but they are cooking the books"" - (1) audited by KPMG and found compliant with IFRS, (2) These numbers are achievable for this type of business

And the valuation:

- PE 6.4
- EV/EBITDA 1.9
- P/CF 5.3

And they have a pleasing 60% payout ratio, equating to a 10% dividend yield currently (and no withholding tax is applied to that).

This is a very financially strong company in a high margin business with very credible growth prospects. They have achieved solid growth even in adverse conditions. I would expect further growth under any conditions - possibly very strong growth should the real estate market rebound.

Combined with the quality of their financials, this is an outstanding prospect.

Factor in whatever degree of compensation you deem appropriate for political risk (you would have to do something extreme for this not to be a good deal)

Fast_Half4523,Possibly undervalued Biotech Firm Bavarian Nordic ,1728573850,1g0lcuf,0,4,"Hi Everyone, 

I tried to ask in the chat for some comments on this company but did not get a response. 

I am interested in Bavarion Nordic, as I believe that after the recent ""hype"" the stock was punished a bit too harshly. 

Bavarian Nordic A/S (BAVA) is a fully integrated danish biotechnology company, focuses on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing vaccines for infectious diseases and immunotherapy treatments for cancer. 

* Infectious Disease Vaccines: The company specializes in producing vaccines for smallpox, monkeypox, rabbies, Ebola, and respiratory diseases.

They make most of their money with vaccines for mpox and rabbies and are late stage for ebola. 

I think the initial ""stock hype"" around mpox is over, but the case numbers are actually increasing rapidly in Africa and the disease is spreading to other countries. Also the new clade is apprently more infectious and dangerous.( I am by no means compare this with Corona). Bavarian Nordic benefited significantly from new vaccine orders and increased its guidance, but the stock actuall fell afterwards. Orders had to be pushed in 2025 and any new orders from the WHO or another country (some donated their vaccines) could lead to an increased guidance. 

New vaccines from moderna or biontech for mpox could only be released earliest in mid 2026 and then would need to get approval from many countries. 

Bavarian Nordic has the only vaccine eligible for children, which the new Clade of mpox is very dangerous for. 

  
P/E is 23, positive cash flow, and nearly no debt. 

  
Is the stock now properly valued or is there upside potential?

  
Thanks!

ghginvest,Belridge Oil and the $10 Billion Lesson from Charlie Munger,1727544663,1frjhu9,0,30,"Investing is supposed to be logical, right? You crunch numbers, look at fundamentals, and if something’s clearly undervalued, you buy. But what happens when emotions, hesitation, or just plain bad judgment get in the way? You miss out on the kind of windfall that keeps you up at night for decades. Just ask Charlie Munger.
In 1977, Munger—a man who built his fortune alongside Warren Buffett—made what he calls his “biggest investing mistake.” A broker called him one day, offering 300 shares of Belridge Oil at $115 per share. Munger saw it for what it was: a no-brainer deal. He took the shares, knowing the company was worth much more than the market price suggested.
The next day, the same broker called back with even better news. There were 1,500 more shares available at the same dirt-cheap price. But Munger hesitated. He had the confidence and the understanding that this was a steal, but he didn’t have the cash on hand. Raising the extra $173,000 would’ve required selling some of his other holdings. He thought it over for 10 minutes and then said, “No.”
That “No” ended up costing him more than $10 billion.

I’m definitely no expert, but I’m passionate about figuring things out and making informed decisions—so I thought, why not document the process and learn together?



In the newsletter, I approach investing as if it’s a fund (without actually being one, of course!) and dive into things like:



• Detailed analysis of investments I’m exploring

• How I make decisions (the wins, the mistakes, and everything in between)

• Transparent reporting on performance



If you’re also learning or curious about investing, feel free to join me on this journey! It’s all about growing our knowledge, sharing experiences, and learning from each other along the way.

realLigerCub,"Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LFCR)",1727908297,1fusy1y,0,1,"Hi all, 

Brand new to Reddit, joining for two main reasons: 

1. To better understand the bear case of my write-ups by receiving constructive criticisms. 
2. For idea generation purposes. 

To introduce myself, I am the author of The Tiger's Prey ([www.thetigersprey.com](https://www.thetigersprey.com/)), an investment newsletter featuring four-page write-ups modeled after traditional sell-side equity research reports, among others. My subscriber base ranges from Ivy League students to a $30bn+ hedge fund. You can also find me on X (@[realLigerCub](https://x.com/realLigerCub)). 

Last week, I shared a write-up on Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. (LFCR), a microcap that has recently experienced a rollercoaster of events. In just the past few quarters, this company has overcome more major events than most companies face in their entire lifecycle. 

Lifecore Biomedical (formerly Landec) operated as a dual-segment company, combining a high-growth CDMO business with several unattractive food divisions, called Curation Foods. After divesting these food businesses following activist pressures, LFCR emerged as a pure-play CDMO and initiated a strategic review process, signaling it was open for sale. However, seasonality issues placed the company in technical default of its debt covenants, before being rescued by its largest customer. Following filing delays, the end of the strategic review without a deal, and disappointing guidance, the stock was beaten down mainly by event-driven investors exiting. With a new CEO at the helm, bringing 30 years of CDMO experience, and the company now current on SEC filings, the market seems to be offering an attractive entry point. The following three bullet points outline my thesis: 

* **New Business Wins:** LFCR benefits from a sticky customer base, but several key catalysts could further expand LFCR’s growing customer list. These include industry consolidation and reshoring trends, the enactment of the BIOSECURE Act, increasing demand for hyaluronic acid due to an aging population, and ongoing shortages of sterile injectables. 
* **Substantial Capacity Additions:** The rising demand for GLP1 drugs has resulted in unprecedented shortages of pharmaceutical products. LFCR's theoretical filling capacity now stands at \~45mm annual units, with a target of reaching \~70mm by FY27. Presently, the company has an annual demand of \~11mm units, and expectations are for significantly faster fill rates as the catalysts outlined above come to fruition. 
* **Strengthened Balance Sheet:** After the debt covenant breach and the receipt of a going concern notice, the company has now adequate liquidity to fund its operations for the foreseeable future, particularly in light of recent profitability and reinvestment developments. Moreover, significant downside protection exists, with any eventual capital raises expected to be non-dilutive. 

To give you an idea of the valuation disconnect, during the last conference call, an unidentified analyst asked LFCR’s management whether double-digit growth is a reasonable expectation beyond FY25. The question went unanswered. The truth is that such growth is achievable even with just the existing late-phase development pipeline and conservative time to commercialization assumptions. A better question would have been how much growth could accelerate if any of the catalysts outlined in this write-up were to materialize.

Several users noted, and [u\\EdoBillions](https://www.reddit.com/user/EdoBillions/) acknowledged in [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1f919qp/new_strategy_update_this_one_has_a_100_success/) that the math in their original post was wrong, but the concept was still of interest to me.

I collected market capitalization and pricing data, sourced from [polygon.io](https://polygon.io/), going back to 2004 for all common stock tickers supported by their API. I excluded companies which were not actively traded at the time and companies which traded OTC. Dividends, fees, and taxes are neglected.

There are two parameters in which I am interested: number of companies included and frequency of rebalancing. Given the thesis in the post which inspired me, I began with only the largest company and rebalancing daily (this also doubles as a backtest result which is easy to verify by hand for validation purposes).

# Daily rebalancing

Over the backtesting period, this variation would have realized an annual return of 15.19% for a total of 1,573.82%. It would, however, also have experienced a *lengthy* drawdown of more than 4 years peak-to-valley and 6 years peak-to-recovery. The strategic failure of the 'largest-company' thesis lies in concentration risk; a single company can underperform the market for a long time before another overtakes its capitalization.

[Largest company only, rebalanced daily](https://i.ibb.co/ccLqpGG/n-1-loris.png)

Expanding the pool to the 10 largest companies improves things substantially: this variation would have realized an annual return of 13.00% for a total of 1,041.22%. The increase in market correlation brought on by even a small diversification of 10 companies is immediately obvious, as is the fact that the strategy underperformed the benchmark for the better part of a decade following the 2008 financial crisis.

[Equal weight of 10 largest companies, rebalanced daily](https://i.ibb.co/z7jwxgm/n-10-daily-loris.png)

The next logical step is to expand the pool further, and I followed that logic with the 50 largest companies -- still with daily rebalancing. Somewhat unsurprisingly, this variation underperforms the benchmark over the backtested period; a testament to the power of volatility decay, I suspect.

[Equal weight of 50 largest companies, rebalanced daily](https://i.ibb.co/D8YLzP8/n-50-daily-loris.png)

# Weekly rebalancing

In practice, daily rebalancing with 50 companies -- even 50 of the largest and probably most liquid companies -- is not possible without algorithmic execution, and not practical with the consideration of fees, commissions, slippage, and losses to the bid-ask spread. A decrease to the frequency of rebalancing is warranted.

Going back to the original thesis of a monolithic portfolio comprised solely of the single largest company we see that weekly rebalancing creates very little difference to daily rebalancing: an annualized return of 14.77% and total return of 1,455.64% with very similar drawdown.

[Largest company only, rebalanced weekly](https://i.ibb.co/MN5LBGp/n-1-weekly-loris.png)

And the same can be said for the [10-largest](https://i.ibb.co/cyxdww4/n-10-weekly-loris.png) and [50-largest](https://i.ibb.co/XJxDwTX/n-50-weekly-loris.png) variations.

# Monthly rebalancing

Monthly rebalancing shows some promise for the single company variation, but that promise is demonstrably spurious as the 10-largest and 50-largest variations evidence.

Background-Metal-601,How to save to retire early? Would you start saving to retire early even if you enjoy the work or would you keep grinding?,1708496694,1aw560f,0,1,"Main question is how to properly save for early retirement? Also what would you do In my shoes?

Long story short I worked my ass off and have been quite lucky. I have an accountant and I'll talk with him more about this when I go do my taxes as well but I'm mid 20s and have a business with 5 employees.

I take a salary of 70k. I work a ton so the math on the hours isn't great but I'm frugal and for now enjoy the work. Anyway it's all under an LLC right now and after all the business expenses are taken care of I'm still having about 12-15k a month left over. Currently my business account has a bit too much cash just sitting there.The business is in construction and while I don't want to scale this much more I have thought about branching out, outright building houses. Coupled with this I could take my lifestyle up a notch or two. Like I said not flashy but I do think I'd enjoy traveling more and traveling rich(er).

Or I up my salary start investing tons of money and retire early. Like forties. I could probably hire someone to run day to day but the hours are crazy bouncing between jobs and would realistically need 2 people. So it'd cost me a lot more than the 70k I pay myself. Would need a good nestegg saved up. 

What would you do? Right now leaning towards a soft retirement in my late 30s early 40s. Would hire someone to share the load of management but would still work some. If i start saving to retire early any pitfalls I should be aware of? Currently just have a Roth I'm contributing the max to which is all mutual funds and an account with about 50k in single stocks (thanks Nvidia lol). Also have like 12k in crypto.

And before anyone says anything I pay my guys well above market rate and give good bonuses I just got really lucky with some long term contracts (who you know who you blow).

I realize how fortunate I am in to be in this situation and I'm just a bit out of my depth with it. Ive just consistently asked people smarter than me for business advice and I'm here doing the same for money advice lol.",investing,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw560f/how_to_save_to_retire_early_would_you_start/
Smart_Insider,Understanding Share Buybacks: Benefits and Implications for Companies and Investors,1708497413,1aw5d76,0,1,[removed],investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw5d76/understanding_share_buybacks_benefits_and/
Eaxecx,Price of Bitcoin vs Value of Bitcoin,1708500597,1aw68na,0,1,"Among Bitcoin supporters, there's a belief that the value of Bitcoin is what the last market participant traded for it. So, if ten years ago someone traded 0.001 dollars for 1 bitcoin, that was bitcoin's value. Today, people trade 50,000 dollars for 1 bitcoin, so that is its value. 

The first question to ask here is why is the value of Bitcoin always expressed in terms of dollars or other items traded on the market. When we, for example, say that two bananas are more valuable than one we don't need dollars or anything else to express this. It is obvious in itself that two bananas give more nutrition than one. 

The above is also true for items such as stocks or fiat currencies. More shares in a company's stock give more dividends, buybacks or funds from an eventual company's liquidation. More dollars give more ability to satisfy debt owed to banks. That's because the Dollar is debt owed to Federal Reserve or commercial banks. It is created as such and gets destroyed with the debt payment. 

So if we say that the higher number of bananas, shares, or dollars is worth more than their lower number, we don't express this in terms of euros, pizzas, haircuts or other items traded on the market. Rather, we express this in terms of bananas, shares or dollars themselves. 

But now let's assume that Alice has 1 bitcoin while Bob has 100 bitcoins. How can Bob show that his holdings are worth more than Alice's holdings? If he says this is because he can get more dollars, pizzas or haircuts on the market, he is expressing the value of bitcoins in terms of items traded for it. He is essentially saying what market participants are currently willing to give for bitcoins. But obviously, this tells us nothing about what bitcoins themselves can give. 

That is why the crucial question to ask is this: what can 100 bitcoins give that is a hundred times more in comparison to what 1 bitcoin can give? 

Is that nutrition? No, bitcoins cannot be eaten. Is that dividend, buyback, or funds from a liquidated company? No, bitcoin is not a share in the ownership of a company. Is that debt satisfaction? No, bitcoin is not created as debt owed to an organization that gets destroyed with debt payment. Is that beauty? No, bitcoin is not art that pleases aesthetic senses. We can keep asking but the answer will always be negative. There's nothing that bitcoins can give. Regardless of whether someone has 1 or 100 bitcoins, both holdings are equally worthless. 

So basically, what the creator of Bitcoin did is come up with a protocol that tells people: 'you own 1 bitcoin', 'you own 5 bitcoins', 'you own 0.001 bitcoin', etc. But that in itself cannot give anything to anyone. It's like a property card in a Monopoly game that tells its holder that they own a train station or electric company. Attributing a game card or a virtual token to someone doesn't magically create value. 

To conclude. What many Bitcoin supporters confuse is price and value. Bitcoin has a price because people pay money such as dollars to hold virtual tokens issued by the Bitcoin protocol. But Bitcoin has no value because, the same as a property or money card in a Monopoly game, the tokens themselves cannot benefit anyone. The whole Bitcoin thing is essentially a kind of investment scheme where people trade valuable items for Monopoly-like money and then hope someone will give them more of such items in the future. And, as this is the case with all such schemes, if others decide not to participate, everything collapses, leaving participants without their investments.",investing,0.24,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw68na/price_of_bitcoin_vs_value_of_bitcoin/

Stockboymoon,Stockanalysis on Zalando - Europe E-Commerce Player,1708502445,1aw6pkf,0,5,"Hi Guys, please mention any flaw you see in my reasoning on the stock or in the numbers I mention, because I know humans are not perfect, especially me.  
  
So Zalando is an E-Commerce Marketplace in Europe and they specialize in Fashion, while having about 7.000 Brands and over 1.8 Million Items on their Plattform.  


Every Number i mentioned can be checked on the zalando investor relations website

  
Strategy:  
  
So the company has a Revenue of about 10.5 Billion in LTM and a GMV of about 14.76. Right now around 40% of their GMV comes from third-parties (This is presented slightly wrong in the document, due to Zalando having other revenue strems than comission and own E-Commerce sales) and they try to execute the same strategy as Amazon is doing right now, which is selling less of their own fashion, which means the GMV should be growing faster than the revenue and the gross Margin should rise.  
  
(Generally i think this development can be seen especially in E-Commerce Marketplaces, due to the E-Commerce Buisness being not that interesting, because of low barriers of entry, with Amazon FBA and Shopify, and not many Synergieeffects, resulting from taking different E-Commerce shops together. Here the only good Differentiations are good reviews or a Brand that people remember, which often goes together. But that just on the side.)  
  
Also like Amazon they provide a Fullfillmentsolution to their Partners, which is also growing in the adoption of the third-party-sales on Zalando. Another interesting area is their acquisition of Highsnobiety, which provides a Fashion Newsfeed, that could enhance Sales through the Inputs provided by the News and could further enhance time spent on the Zalando website and App, which improves customerconnection and Sales.  
  
I even think, that a Marketplace in the fashion e-commerce space should be even more interesting as a buisness model, than amazons marketplace model right now, due to the higher margins on the products, which can also lead to way higher comissions, than Amazon can charge for 10 meters of tape or something like that. So Zalando can maybe profit from their partners brands and the differentiation, that comes with them.  
  
Financials and Macro:  
  
So even though the strategy sounds pretty good, the numbers haven't performed in the same way. This is mostly due to 2022 and 2023 being pretty rough years for E-Commerce, due to people shopping a bit more in the real world again and mostly just the macro being much worse in general. The problem with fashion is, that it is very cyclical, because these expenses aren't life preserving and can easily be cut back a bit. Furthermore nearly all big fashion players in Europe, like About You, Asos and so on orderd way to much inventory in 2021, because they thought the E-Commerce trend would go on like in the covid times. (This can be seen pretty nicely, when visiting the $YOU ticker for About you or the $ZAL for Zalando and looking on the inventory as a percantage of revenue. - which should, with Zalando getting more of their revenue through comissions and other revenue streams, decrese -  
  
These Problems caused Zalandos GMV to shrink right now with -2.5 %, with active customers in LTM also shrinking Q on Q. However this has to be seen relative to industrie peers, for example Asos shrinking -10 % or boohoo also - 10% and About you also slightly shrinking with -0.5%. So here you can see Zalando and About you taking performing way better than the rest of the European e-commerce market.  
  
A Development which is especially linked to the high inventory levels is way lower gross margin, visible at every of the before mentioned companies. This comes from every Fashionshop trying to sell their inventory off, because they want to avoid big depreciation and amortization expenses. However this process is now close to being done, with many of the mentioned e-commerce shops having way healthier inventory numbers.

kumaramit0703,Wealth advice I would give to my younger self,1708594377,1ax2fmy,0,67,"Here is some advice I would give to my younger self that I have distilled after a decade of starting my career. I still have a long way to go, but these are hard-earned learnings I thought of sharing. I will keep it as compass for remaining decades of my life. I hope, it can be of some help to you too in your own money journey.

**#1: Become financially educated.** Our schools and society don’t teach us much about money, so you must learn it yourself early on. Learn to earn, spend, manage, invest, and grow wealth. Personal finance is neither complex nor boring, so don’t outsource it. It only takes a bit of effort to master a few key ideas and practices. This little effort will massively reduce stress about money from your life.

**#2: Have a vision for yourself.** Plans don’t always work out the way we imagine, but being intentional helps. Visualize how your life would be like years and decades out. Your future image should come from a place deep inside of you, not from your ego. Don’t think of grandiose ideas about how big you will be one day. Instead, aim to be financially independent early so you can do things that add meaning to your life.

**#3: Choose right work.** Choose a profession where you can enjoy the work even when results are not visible in short-term. If you don’t know what that is, just follow your intuition. It’s your best guide. Don’t choose a role because it feels prestigious or offers little more money. It will take a long time to become at good at anything, so choose work that gives you energy. Getting this right is way more important than accumulating wealth.

**#4: Maximize your earnings.** Once you have chosen your craft, think about how you can maximize your earnings over time. Invest in yourself and over-index on learning new skills. Try to become a more valuable person each passing year. Most importantly, be in the right environment. There are certain markets — like different industries and geographies — that will compensate you much better for your skills. For instance, job in the Bay Area would pay a lot more for same engineering skills than most parts of the world. Make all effort to transition to the environment that’s best for you. That will compound your earnings, connections, and happiness in the long-term.

**#5: Spend way less than you earn.** There is no shame in living frugally, especially in early part of your career. Aim for savings rate north of 20%. If you do that, you will keep more and need less to be financially independent. Deeply ingrain the idea that happiness does not have a lot to do with money. Precious things in life are free anyways, be it spending time with loved ones or losing yourself in your craft.

**#6: Invest in fast growing assets.** You will become wealthy when you own assets that can grow fast in value, like real estate or stocks. Stocks are volatile, but easier to manage. Real estate is more stable, but requires oversight. If you don’t want to manage individual stocks, buy diversified index funds. The key is to buy and hold for the long-term and let the growth compound. Things that don’t generate cash, like gold and bitcoin, are speculative. Play around with it if you want, but don’t make it the centerpiece of your investing strategy.

**#7: Aim for a few big hits.** There are a few asymmetrical bets that can have massive payoff. You can start a company or a join an early-stage startup with equity. You can start a side business or become a creator to share useful content with the world. You can even invest in undervalued stocks or real estate. These bets can take many forms. The odds of success of any one is low, but you can try as many times as you want. All you need is one big hit to change your life.

**#8: Know what you are chasing.** Play your own game. Do not compare with others because someone will always be in a better spot. Know when and what is enough for you. Don’t obsessively chase a target net worth number. Don’t revolve your life around a spreadshee",investing,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ax2fmy/wealth_advice_i_would_give_to_my_younger_self/

RyMzey,401K Rolled over to Empower after new job,1708297217,1au7oj2,0,1,"As the title says - but I want to figure out some things. Im currently 30 years old. 

1.) currently my 401k is traditional at about 50k. If I were smarter, I would’ve originally signed this up as a Roth personally. At my age and current status, is it possible I could call Empower and pay the taxes on this to roll over to a Roth? Would that even be a good idea since that’d be a big lump sum to pay? Or should I just continue on with my traditional at this point.

2.) I rolled the trad 401k from vanguard. To be honest, when the Empower employee helped me he was not very thorough with what I should expect with the rollover. I seem to have no visibility of what’s going on with that 50k if it’s even invested with anything or not. I had full scope of this with vanguard. Should this be something I should ask about?

3.) I wanted to start setting up a Roth ASAP when I realized that’s the path I wanted to go to start saving. So everything that I’m pulling out on paychecks is currently starting again new in a new Roth IRA they set up for me. Was this a bad decision? Because now I have a small Roth account with a bigger traditional 401k just sitting there and quite honestly I just want to continue growing the bigger pot where I can possible so I’m just torn at the direction I want to go for my investments. 

Any thoughts or answers to my questions are greatly appreciated. I do plan to call Empower sometime next week to sort this out but having a better idea of what I want ahead of time may be the better move.

JustinianIV,Inverted Curve - Long or Short term bonds?,1708387503,1av375l,0,4,"I’m learning about bonds. The yield curve is inverted right now, so short term bonds have higher yields. I have a chunk of emergencyish cash sitting around. I need this to be somewhat liquid, accessible within 3 months at most.

I’m looking at buying US 1 month bonds. From what i understand, i get 5.4% annualized return. My risk is rates being cut and the yield falling. I don’t mind that, I can hold for 1 month to maturity.

Alternatively I could buy longer term bonds like 10Y, get a lower yield (4.2%), but expect to make capital gains and sell when the rates are cut. Risk is rates going up more because i’m stuck with lower bond prices and locked in for 10 years, but that would be suicidal for the economy.

questions:
1. If rates are cut, shouldn’t the short term bond price also increase?
2. What am i missing in terms of risks here?

Is it beneficial to carry debt and if so, how much and why?

duhlishus,Enhanced DRIP idea - buy on ex-dividend date instead of payment date,1722020372,1ecw0j7,0,4,"First brokerage to implement this idea wins a gold star and a cookie.

You know how the stock price always goes down on the ex-dividend date?

Enhanced DRIP would buy more of the stock on that date.

Normal DRIP waits until the dividend payment date, when the stock price has usually recovered a bit, missing the buying opportunity.

You may ask, how could Enhanced DRIP buy shares if you haven't received the dividend payment yet? Well, Enhanced DRIP could use your core position, spending the amount that was announced. If core funds are insufficient, Enhanced DRIP could auto-liquidate your cash-equivalent positions. If cash equivalents are insufficient, Enhanced DRIP could borrow on margin. If available margin is insufficient, or margin is not enabled, then Enhanced DRIP would finally decide to wait for the dividend payment date.

Normal DRIP should still be available as an option. Statements could say ""Enhanced DRIP has improved your cost basis by X amount of dollars, compared to buying on the dividend payment date"" to help investors decide if they should keep Enhanced DRIP enabled or go back to Normal DRIP.

Another possible enhancement: allow investors to specify an additional percent to spend. Since ex-dividend dates are effectively a nice little dip, investors may appreciate automatic purchases that are more than just the dividend amount. For example, if the announced dividend is $1.00 per share, and the investor has specified an Enhanced DRIP percentage of 200%, then $2.00 per share would be used for the automatic purchase on the ex-dividend date.",investing,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ecw0j7/enhanced_drip_idea_buy_on_exdividend_date_instead/

**Let's start with the big macroeconomics**

We all know China’s economy is pretty bad right now. There’s a reason a lot of Chinese stocks have been beaten down. Also the geopolitical tensions does not help. However I do see China making a recovery over the coming years. This is a pretty safe bet IMO.

[https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/item/RD\_13569\_40890/business-cycle-update.html?pos=T](https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/item/RD_13569_40890/business-cycle-update.html?pos=T)

China is ahead of everyone in the business cycle. Most of the world has yet to experience a real contraction. This brings me to another point: Investors will start to chase yield when the US starts their contraction phase. China looks to be the only market that will be out of their contraction phase at that point.

His current 2 top holdings are BABA and JD. Looking at his portfolio was what tipped me off to look into them. You also have the opportunity to get in at a lower price than Michael Burry.

Pros

* The average forecast for JD in 12 months is $40.58

[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jd/forecast)

* EBITDA Margin has a lot of room to grow 2.27% compared to BABA (19.47%)
* Predicted to grow until 2027
* Generate a lot of revenue compared to their market cap of 42B

[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jd/earnings](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jd/earnings)

* $0.74 Dividend

Risks

* Low EBITDA Margin (because if it slips then they can easily become unprofitable)
* Geopolitical tensions
* Charts are pretty bearish (stock has gone almost nowhere past few years)
* Betting on China
* Question that came across my mind was “WHERE IS ALL THEIR MONEY GOING?”

**My Plan**

I am going to start building a position on JD. I have pretty bad timing so I will be buying in set increments while keeping an eye on their earnings. I will look for leaps given the right price. I am not going to throw my entire portfolio into. I also like BABA but I believe JD has high potential for return.

For some reason I have a mental block against 401k or a Roth IRA. I guess I should at least contribute the match to my employer (measly 3%) and put it into a Roth IRA. At the least. 

I’ve looked at index funds, maybe will invest in SMH. Semi conductors have rallied like crazy and they probably won’t slow down in our new AI overlord reality. 

I like crypto because it was my first introduction to investing, but though I made a lot of money in 2013-2017, I lost it all learning to find the balance between investing and gambling. 

I like the idea of real estate investing, especially the idea of renting out a duplex or quadplex, or even flipping houses or cars. 

The thing is, is that I like to see $100k in my account. It feels secure. Like, WHAT if I need 50k all of a sudden? If my car shit itself right now, I’d probably want to drop 15-20k so that I don’t have payments. Debt, which I have 0 of, is how I want to stay. 

So anyways, advice would be appreciated. I’m planning to do digital nomad visa and move to Croatia soon. My main concern is that I don’t like the idea that most of my money could go down in value and I wouldn’t really have access to it because that’s the point of investing, having it invested.

# 1. Smartpay Holding Limited (NZE: SPY)

Smartpay is a small but growing player in the payment processing space, and what’s exciting here is the strong insider and institutional buying that has occurred during the company’s recent dip. This confidence from those closest to the business is a positive signal for future growth.  
**Key point**: Smartpay’s combination of growth potential and its appealing valuation make it an interesting long-term play, especially as insiders continue to increase their positions.

I especially like that Microequities Asset Management holds a 13.3% stake in the company, as this fund has an incredible track record of investing in deep value opportunities in Australia. The fund’s director, Carlos Gil, is also a member of the company's board, which makes this investment even more attractive.

# 2. Alpha Group (ALPH)

Alpha Group remains a compelling value opportunity. Insider buying has been strong, and even with conservative estimates, the company appears undervalued. At a potential entry price of $21, the risk/reward ratio is extremely attractive, as the stock could easily be worth over $30 per share. After the substantial decrease in stock price following the news that the founder and CEO would be stepping down, we have seen strong insider and institutional buying, taking advantage of the lower prices.  
**Key point**: The stock’s fundamentals and insider confidence make this a compelling opportunity for those looking to invest in undervalued companies with a strong business model.

# 3. Friedman Industries (FRD)

Friedman Industries is a U.S.-based metals producer facing temporary pressure due to low iron prices. These low prices are driven by increased exports from China (up 36.2% in 2023, with a forecasted 20% rise in 2024). Friedman has grown its revenues fivefold over the last decade thanks to a mix of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Key point: If iron prices rise, especially with potential economic stimulus from China, Friedman’s margins could improve significantly. With just a 4% margin, the company would trade at an impressive 21% free cash flow yield. Insiders hold 4.6% of the company and have been increasing their positions in recent months, signaling long-term confidence in the business.

Steel prices are at really low levels, the cost of production has risen a lot since 2020 so it is unlikely that the price will fall further as it would make unprofitable most of the steel producing sector

# 4. Ingles Markets (IMKTA)

Ingles Markets is a regional supermarket chain that is undervalued due to its substantial, yet underappreciated, real estate holdings. The fair value of its land alone is estimated to exceed the company’s current market capitalization, making this a potential net/net opportunity. Recent events, like the hurricane that affected some of its operating regions, led to a temporary 15% drop in the stock price.  
**Understanding the hurricane impact**:  
The hurricane caused significant flooding, affecting road infrastructure and hampering deliveries. Additionally, Ingles' credit card processing systems were disrupted, forcing some stores to operate on cash and checks.

Traditional-Jump6145,Is Celsius Undervalued after 70% drop?,1728334524,1fyidu9,0,77,"This stock has been on a wild ride, delivering over 3,000% returns since 2019, but faced a 70% correction from all-time highs. Is this panic selling? to me it looks like it probably was very over-valued. But I also think it might be undervalued now.



Celsius has been stealing market share from Monster and Red Bull. Since the first quarter of 2022, Red Bull's market share has dropped by 2.2%, and Monster's has declined by 3.2%. Meanwhile, Celsius has grown from 3.6% to 11.4% market share. Overall the energy drink market continues to grow. 



The household penetration of energy drinks has increased from 64.8% to 70.5% this year (about 10% growth)



In the first quarter of 2024, Celsius reported 37% year-over-year sales growth, international sales growing even faster at 43%. Their gross margin is 51.2%, and net income increased by 89%. It's great growth but it is a decline from last years 95% growth. This seems to be the reason for the sell off, but it's pretty reasonable to expect a slow down of growth at their size.



Celsius has a strong balance sheet. $880 million in cash and cash equivalents, more than enough to cover their liabilities. A solid financial position. This means they can continue to invest in growth without the fear of running into financial trouble. Plus, their operating cash flow is robust, with $135 million generated in the first quarter of 2024 alone. This is a clear indicator of a profitable business that’s generating cash consistently.



But what about the valuation? Currently, Celsius trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 4.56, which is about a 30% discount compared to Monster's 7.67. Celsius has a higher growth rate than Monster which makes it seem undervalued. Celsius and Monster are trading below Monster's 10-year average price to sales ratio of 8.7, just to bring the case home.



[Analysts project](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/CELH/analyst) a compounded annual growth rate of 18.3% for Celsius's revenue over the next five years. 



So, what do you think? Is Celsius a hidden gem in the energy drink market, or do you believe the stock is too risky at its current valuation? Let’s discuss!",ValueInvesting,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fyidu9/is_celsius_undervalued_after_70_drop/

ivegotwonderfulnews,Ambac Insurance - worth a look for Value Investors,1728584031,1g0p9q0,0,7,"Most of us here know a bit about insurance through Buffett. Older investors probably remember Ambac Ins and how they got crushed during the financial crisis due to underwriting MBS. They came out of bankruptcy in 2013 and have been basically bouncing around between $30 and $10 since then. It turns out that the primary assets being of value  within Ambac is/was the ongoing litigation with the banks that created all those terrible MBS as well as $1billion plus nol carryforwards. The stock has gone up and down based on how investors saw the value of litigation awards (Ambac was suing the banks for billions). Some were estimating that $1-3 billion or more might be recovered eventually. Over the same time Ambac has started a small specialty P&C insurer (A- AM Best) and more recently been acquiring stakes in P&C MGAs (think insurance agencies).  Thats the basics..... 

In June the comapny announced they are selling the entire ""litigation"" to Oaktree Capital for $420 million which is well below what many investors thought the company's claims were worth and the stock was basically cut in half within days. The deal with Oaktree is supposed to close at the end of the year. Post transaction the comapny is left with a tangible book value of around $700 million, well reserved and no debt with a market cap of around $500 million. ..Oh and the company said they are going to do a $50 million buy back after the deal closes (catalyst?) Obv this doesn't contemplate the expected (hoped for?) growth in rev and earnings in the coming years as they remake themselves.

I'm leaving out plenty of details. There is a great shareholder presentation on their IR site  which will fill in the blanks but basically this is a small forgotten comapny with a name that associates with bad things in people minds. Its way to small for most inst investors and doesn't screen well due to the runoff of the legacy business. At first look it seems like there may be some ""value"" here.....

DavidThi303,How can I invest in the companies selling to the power companies,1728584915,1g0plu0,0,7,"Hi all;

My first question here. I think there's going to be a large increase in power generation, especially in the U.S. but also worldwide. The power plants and transmission lines are built for and run by the power companies and they're a boring investment. Double the power generated means maybe double the value.

But the companies that supply everything to these utilities - those can grow by multiples. So is there an index fund the covers this? The companies that make the power generators (solar cells, turbines, etc.), transformers, power cables, etc. All of that?

And not just green energy (SMOG, CNRG), but all forms of power generation. And the transmission & storage. So a fund that includes battery makers, but does not include Tesla (green energy, but not power generation).

Does such a thing exist?

s0methingggg,Rabbit Hole of Investing ,1727559879,1froz99,0,11,"So I’m very new to this, I understand this stuff takes very long to learn and understand. I didn’t go to college for any of this.
And about 6 months ago became super determined to do more for myself and my wife. 
I’ve learned a little bit in this time, but have ways to go. I’ve read some books. Dabbled in day trading and options with paper account. Just to kind of feel some different things out and try to dip my toes in with different methods, strategies and instruments.

Where I’m at currently, I believe the most sound and practical approach to potentially deploying the money I’ve worked my entire life for would be the value investors approach.

I want to manage an IRA for my wife and I that’s nice and safe, VOO maybe some total world stocks

But I want a taxable account for just myself where I spend time doing thorough DD, looking for “wonderful companies at a fair price” not to sound cliche, and maybe some bonds in there for a layer of risk management. Correct me if that’s wrong.

I’ve been reading books
Watching videos
Taking notes
Technical analysis wasn’t too hard to grasp, but that won’t be super important, I may use it lightly after the fact, but what I’m struggling with is

I’m really determined to get a rock solid understanding of how to value a company, how to calculate FCF, DCF

I’m wondering if anyone could recommend maybe books, a solid YouTube channel, or even affordable online courses that may help me over this early plateau, I refuse to give up on this, but fundamental analysis has me stumped and I’m not about to yeet to my savings into a company because some website using AI is telling me it’s “undervalued”

“Yet, the path to expansion is not without its hurdles. The offering is subject to customary closing conditions, including the green light from the Canadian Securities Exchange and a nod from The Nasdaq Stock Market. Such regulatory landscapes are complex and demand careful navigation. Draganfly's move is underpinned by a solid legal framework, leveraging an effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, alongside the company's Canadian short form base shelf prospectus. The anticipation builds as the final terms of the offering are to be disclosed in a final prospectus supplement, a document that will mark the culmination of meticulous planning and strategic foresight.”

15% cash - in a money market fund currently
60% US large cap growth/value
10% US mid/small cap
10% alternative assets - a mix of bitcoin/gold/reits
5% international equity fund - this is mostly in my 401k.

This would be $14,000 total contributed into my father IRA for this year, is this okay since they file taxes jointly?

This was not a responsible choice but I didn’t have much money at the time and was very likely to end up having a high paying career after grad school so I figured why not. 

Since then my holding in NVDA has increased in value by about 7x. Because my income did go up significantly after grad school this represents only about 1% of my net holdings, but still feels like a position that I definitely would not buy into today despite me still believing in the company for the same reasons I did before.

But if you do, that money is tied to a singular purpose, and you don’t even know if your kid(s) will need/use it. Use it for something else and you pay a penalty. Furthermore, that tax advantage is almost nonexistent. This is because most people don’t contribute until well after kids are born, so money has limited time to grow - the only tax advantage is on that growth part. (I recognize some states give you a break on state income taxes, but that’s small change and usually this ties you to that state’s funds, which may not make any financial sense.)

Certainly there are use cases where it makes sense - namely if you’re rich and can toss in a huge chunk right when your kid is born.

This post, is more like a question/guide as I just got my 1099 from Schwab (the broker that i use only to buy SGOV and SWVXX). However, the 1099 composite did not break down how much $ was exempt from state tax. I'm following [this](https://thefinancebuff.com/state-tax-exempt-treasury-fund-etf.html) guide and hopefully can be useful for other people who bought $SGOV or any other tax exempt ETFs in 2023.

Here is the screenshot of my [1099 composite](https://imgbb.com/upload) as you can see its only 1 got box filled, but if i scroll down to the dividend section, you see [2 entries](https://imgbb.com/upload) with the amount of dividends i received in 2023. So, following the guide that i hyperlinked earlier, i look at % of SGOV which is [96.45%](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/tax-information/2023-ishares-us-government-source-income-information-stamped.pdf). 

Therefore, to calculate how much i put in my taxes on freetaxusa, i would put $230 in box 1, select ""Yes"" on ""Is this a mutual fund that has U.S. Government interest income?"" and on the next page I will put $**219.82884** on the box that says ""Enter the amount of your $230 of ordinary dividends that are from U.S. Government interest:""  


The formula I got $219.82884 comes from $227.92 (total dividends i received in 2023 from $SGOV) \* 96.45% (U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS\*/% from Treasuries).

Sufficient-Camp9586,I’m a deep value investor and I bought Nvidia,1728353794,1fyp9ew,0,1,"Yes, I’m a deep value investor and yes, I paid 56 times earnings for Nvidia. Typically I look for low
P/E companies that have a moat - think coke bottler or big Japanese trading companies. But after looking at Nvidia and getting past all the market euphoria around it, I decided to buy it.

It’s a great business. It’s one that I think you have to pay up for and forget you have it for 10-20 years. Reasons are below:

1. 80% market share

2. Incredibly high switching costs - you can’t just buy and chips for 20% less and switch them in. Likely 2x cost to put new ones in. Also a company that tries to switch risks serious disruptions - something they can’t afford. Imagine if you were a major AWS customer and performance suffered because Amazon tried a switch to a different company - there would be uproar.

3. Gross margins are high - 70%+

4. Big tech cloud and services businesses are growing rapidly. They need more and more computing power everyday. Nvidia is the one behind them supplying it. Microsoft, Tesla, google, Amazon are major customers 

5. AI is real. Media definitely talks about it too futuristically but we all use chat gpt. It can’t run without Nvidia. As AI continues to scale the need for high performance computing will grow with it - Nvidia.

6. The CEO is a once in a generation type. He’s also the founder, has both skin in the game and is exceptional.

7. Macro trends - the amount of data will not ever go down in the world. Companies are going to be accumulating more and more of it and trying to analyze more and more of it. The need for advanced computing is going to grow exponentially- there sits Nvidia.

8. Their technology is clearly superior to competitors - intel, amd. Their latest chip - Blackwell has unbelievable demand. 

As much as I hate paying a high price, I had to do it for this business. Will see how it plays out in time.

i4value,MNRB – bigger does not mean better,1728618303,1g110lg,0,1,"Bursa MNRB is a leading provider of reinsurance and retakaful as well as takaful. You would have thought that with a captive reinsurnance market and being a poineer in the takaful sector, it would be a roaring success.



While MNRB had been able to grow its revenue at 5.2% over the past decade, PAT only grew at about half the rate. When I compared MNRB's performance with those of the other Bursa insurance companies, I found that it is at best just below the panel average.



There was a run up in its share price a couple of months ago following a very good first quarter result. Unfortunately this was not sustained in the second quarter. So the company is still trading significantly below its book value. 



[MNRB's](https://www.i4value.asia/2024/02/is-mnrb-value-trap.html#more) problems are more about poor operating fundamentals – profitability, underwriting performance, and investment. If these could be improved we will have fantastic performance. So maybe the market waiting for this to happen before any re-rating.

Electronic_Debt_8523,"U.S. Gold Corp: Advancing Exploration Across Promising U.S. Properties
",1728652044,1g19czu,0,1,"**U.S. Gold Corp ($USAU)** is a U.S.-focused gold exploration and development company, strategically positioned with a diverse portfolio of exploration properties across key mining regions in the country. As the global demand for gold continues to rise, the company is working to advance its projects, which are rich in both gold and copper, through exploration, development, and eventual production. This positions U.S. Gold Corp to capitalize on the ongoing bull market for gold.

# CK Gold Project – Wyoming

The company’s flagship project, the **CK Gold Project**, is located in **Southeast Wyoming**. This shovel-ready project sits on Wyoming state land, providing a safe and mining-friendly jurisdiction with a streamlined permitting process. The CK Gold Project is significant for its rich gold and copper deposits, offering an exciting opportunity for both precious and industrial metal production. Once fully developed, the project is expected to contribute significantly to U.S. Gold Corp’s value proposition, providing both economic benefits and crucial domestic copper supplies, as copper is increasingly essential for renewable energy and electric vehicle (EV) markets.

# Maggie Creek – Nevada

In **Nevada**, U.S. Gold Corp is exploring properties located on the **Cortez** and **Carlin Trends**, some of the most prolific gold mining regions in the world. The **Maggie Creek** property benefits from being in close proximity to some of the largest gold-producing mines in the U.S., making it a highly promising exploration site. Nevada’s well-established mining infrastructure and supportive regulations further enhance the potential for discovery and development in this area.

# Challis Gold Project – Idaho

U.S. Gold Corp’s **Challis Gold Project** is located in **Idaho**, another resource-rich state with a long history of mining. The project covers an area known for historical gold production, and early-stage exploration results indicate promising potential for significant resource growth. With Idaho’s favorable mining regulations and increasing interest in domestic gold production, Challis represents a valuable asset in the company’s portfolio.

# Conclusion

With a robust portfolio of exploration properties in mining-friendly states like **Wyoming, Nevada,** and **Idaho**, U.S. Gold Corp is well-positioned to become a leading player in the U.S. gold industry. The company’s focus on developing its flagship CK Gold Project and advancing its other exploration assets ensures that it is well-aligned with the growing demand for both gold and critical minerals like copper. As the gold bull market progresses, U.S. Gold Corp’s projects have the potential to deliver significant returns to investors.",ValueInvesting,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1g19czu/us_gold_corp_advancing_exploration_across/

StockCompil,Chinese stocks featured in hedge fund reports,1728655001,1g1ae91,0,16,"Hi,

Here are the Chinese stocks I’ve come across in Hedge Fund Q2 reports.

Source : [https://stockanalysiscompilation.substack.com/p/hedge-funds-best-ideas-9](https://stockanalysiscompilation.substack.com/p/hedge-funds-best-ideas-9)

  
**O'Keefe Stevens on Alibaba**

Alibaba is the largest e-commerce player in China, with 40% gross merchandise volume (GMV) market share through its Taobao and T-mall businesses. While the cloud computing business is relatively small, its 37% market share in China positions it well to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-related products. In the most recent quarter, AI-related cloud revenue recorded triple-digit growth y/y, with the expectation that total cloud revenue will accelerate to double-digit growth in 2H 2025. It’s rare to find a dominant market share business with significant tailwinds trading for \~10x adj. EPS. After accounting for their \~$60B net cash balance sheet, the stock is trading at 6-7x, which, we believe, is far too cheap. We understand this business would not trade at this price if it were a U.S. business. However, the valuation gap at a high single-digit P/E is pricing in a combination of the following risks – 1. China invading Taiwan. 2. Cash can never leave mainland China (disproven). 3. Increasing competition from Pinduoduo and Shien resulting in market share loss 4. China’s geopolitical tensions worsen. 5. Economic slowdown stemming from the recent housing market downturn. 6. VIE structure creates doubt over the actual ownership of the business. All risks have merit, with cash distribution restrictions at the lower end due to the recently announced dividend and special dividend. Cash returned to shareholders totaled $16.5B in FY24, up from $13.4B in FY23. All investments carry risks; some can be diversified away, and others cannot. While incremental investments and spending will likely lead to margin compression, this is a necessary step to stabilize and potentially regain market share. The risk of continued market share loss from Pinduoduo (Temu), JD.com, Shein, and Douyin is shown below. Alibaba’s Chinese market share has declined from 78% in 2015 to 44% in 2022 and 40% in 2023. The under-reinvestment in the business opened the door for others to come in. Joe Tsai, Chairman, stated Alibaba had shot itself in the foot over the last decade, not prioritizing the end-user experience. Eddie Wu, who took over as CEO in late 2023, has prioritized improvements in the user interface. This reinvestment should help mitigate future market share losses. We expect capital returns through dividends and buybacks to continue for the foreseeable future. The business generates substantial free cash flow, cumulatively over the next 5-6 years, could total today’s enterprise value.

**Davis fund on Tencent**

Within its social media platforms, we expect Tencent to see meaningful gains from AI-driven ranking and recommendation improvements in areas like Video Accounts, the company’s short-form video product that has become a core use case within WeChat. Ranking and recommendation improvements drive increases in user engagement as well as advertising efficiency across the platform via better targeting and personalization. In addition, generative AI will make it easier for content creators and advertisers to create engaging content and advertisements, further increasing the monetization potential of its platform. As the most popular messaging app in China, WeChat also provides Tencent a massive distribution advantage that will enable it to quickly launch and scale any breakthrough generative AI products that might develop over time. One example is with search, where we think the company has an opportunity to leverage generative AI technology to gain substantial share in the search market. Generative AI also has obvious applications in the company’s video game business. We expect Tencent will utilize generative AI to create more engaging video games by, for example, making non-playe",ValueInvesting,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1g1ae91/chinese_stocks_featured_in_hedge_fund_reports/

conquistudor,Simply Good Foods (SMPL): A 20-Year Bet on a Healthier Future,1727608139,1fs1xtm,0,6,"I'm looking to invest in SMPL as part of a 20-year strategy focused on consumer goods that can thrive even in downturns. While many other consumer stocks are either overpriced or saddled with debt, Simply Good Foods stands out as a reasonably valued player with strong growth potential and low debt. For context, I’m open to other recommendations that match these criteria, but I’m especially interested in how Simply Good Foods fits into a longer-term (value investing), or even growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) approach.

# What Makes Simply Good Foods Unique?

The company owns three brands – Atkins, Quest, and OWYN – each targeting the health-conscious consumer with low-carb, high-protein, and plant-based snacks. With net sales of $955.6 million in 2023 and a growing market share, it's positioned perfectly to benefit from trends in healthy eating and lifestyle. Quest saw sales grow by 14.2% last year, driving solid financial performance.

**Balance Sheet Strength**: Simply Good Foods operates an asset-light model, outsourcing production, which keeps costs low and free cash flow high. As of the last quarter, the company grew its cash reserves from $87.7 million to $208.7 million, while reducing debt to $237.7 million. This balance sheet flexibility is great for weathering economic storms and fueling growth.

# The OWYN Acquisition

In 2024, Simply Good Foods acquired Only What You Need (OWYN), a plant-based protein brand, for $280 million. This move taps into a booming market for plant-based protein, adding a third pillar to the company's product lineup. By leveraging its strong e-commerce channels (21% of Quest and 14% of Atkins sales), Simply Good Foods can expand OWYN’s reach efficiently.

# Why Simply Good Foods is Well-Positioned

Unlike giants like Abbott or General Mills, Simply Good Foods focuses on niche consumer trends, providing a moat through specialized products. Its marketing is on point – digital-first, influencer-driven, and social media savvy – driving customer loyalty and awareness. The company's strategic focus on innovation and distribution gives it a competitive edge in a fragmented market.

# Value & Growth Outlook

**Valuation Check**: The stock's **P/E ratio** of **23.9** and **Forward P/E** of **17.0** are attractive given its growth and healthy balance sheet. With a **Debt/Equity** ratio of **0.14** and consistent earnings, there’s a solid margin of safety here.

**Growth Drivers**: The rise of plant-based diets, low-carb snacking, and protein-rich foods is here to stay. Simply Good Foods is ready to capitalize on these long-term consumer trends, delivering shareholder value through efficient capital use, solid branding, and ongoing innovation.

# Final Take

Simply Good Foods is a compelling play for value investors who want steady growth in the booming health and wellness sector. With strong financials, a growing market presence, and disciplined management, this stock fits a GARP profile and offers potential for robust returns over the long term.

I’m open to other suggestions for consumer brands with low debt and reasonable valuations. And I'd love to hear from those who’ve tried Atkins, Quest, or OWYN – whether you liked or disliked them. Consumer sentiment matters, and your experience could help shape the investment case.

OperationTestify,DEME over DOF over Cadeler,1727609164,1fs270z,0,2,"Many of you have apparently read (or at least downloaded) my latest research report on Danish vessel operator Cadeler (can be found here: https://mikecsnaire.wixsite.com/idothenumbers). I concluded that I loved the company, but found it either fairly priced or slightly overpriced at the moment based on my free cash flow projections and other factors.

As part of my assessment, I came across two peer companies called DEME Group (Belgium) and DOF Group (Norway). After looking into both of them, I am very bullish on both, seeing DEME currently having an edge on fair valuation. But both companies can be considered cheap, seeing that they are basically priced at their vessel book values. Both have an order book that covers several years, are growing quickly, are highly profitable and have a solid (read: not overlevered) balance sheets.

Vessel operators servicing the offshore industry (oil, gas and wind) have a sublime growth outlook and pricing power until at least the end of the decade. All three companies (DEME, DOF and Cadeler) are expanding their fleets to be ready for the expansion expected in offshore wind over the next 2-3 decades (CAGR until 2033 of around 20%).

In my view, DEME is currently the most attractive of the three companies. They have the biggest fleet and are way more diversified than DOF and Cadeler. Top line growth is impressive, operating margins and RoPP&E are increasing as well.

DOF is a close second. They cleaned up their balance sheet and are still much more focused on oil and gas. But the range of services is attractive and they are getting ready for the expanding floating offshore wind market from 2028 onwards. They just acquired Maersk Services, thereby adding to their fleet and scope.

All three went public over the past few years and made good use on either raising more equity since or using their increasing valuations for stock-paid acquisitions.

I feel comfortable adding them to my long positions, weights skewed to DEME.",ValueInvesting,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fs270z/deme_over_dof_over_cadeler/

raytoei,"When you leak this news 3 weeks before earnings, you are basically saying that, if the news is bad, at least you are doing something about it",1728017192,1fvrabo,0,30,"Amazon could cut 14,000 managers soon and save $3 billion a year, according to Morgan Stanley

Amazon's plan to have fewer managers could result in huge job cuts and cost savings.

CEO Andy Jassy said last month that he wanted to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Jassy argued that having fewer managers would remove unnecessary organizational layers and help Amazon move faster without bureaucratic hurdles.

In a note published on Thursday, Morgan Stanley estimated that this effort could lead to the elimination of roughly 13,834 manager roles by early next year, resulting in cost savings of $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion.

The estimate assumes that 7% of Amazon's workforce is in management positions. At the end of the second quarter, Amazon had about 105,770 managers globally; that would drop to 91,936 in the first quarter of next year based on Morgan Stanley's estimate. Amazon doesn't publicly disclose a breakdown of its workforce.

Advertisement

Amazon told Business Insider that it had ""added a lot of managers"" in recent years and that ""now is the right time"" to make this change. Every team within Amazon will review its structure, and it's possible that organizations may eliminate roles that are no longer required, the company said, adding that the change was about ""strengthening our culture and organizations."" It declined to comment on Morgan Stanley's specific projections.

Morgan Stanley assumed that the cost per manager was $200,000 to $350,000 a year. Based on those numbers, Amazon would stand to save $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion next year if it cut those 13,834 manager roles. Morgan Stanley estimated that the savings would account for roughly 3% to 5% of Amazon's projected operating profit for 2025.


Amazon has more than 1.5 million total employees, a lot of whom work in the company's warehouses and logistics operations and aren't part of its corporate workforce.

The company could change the ratio of individual contributors to managers through other methods beyond cutting jobs. It could have managers take on new roles, for instance.

Still, Morgan Stanley sees a huge opportunity for Amazon to make itself more efficient with these big moves.

""Removing layers, operating with fewer managers and flattening the organization are all in focus to move faster,"" it said in the note.

But over the past decade, Harrisons revenue grew at 5% CAGR with its profits growth at 8% CAGR.



Harrisons main distribution business is in Sabah and Sarawak. I suspect that because these states are less developed, the last mile service critical to online business is not so well developed. So there is greater reliance on the brick-and-mortar outlets. This is Harrisons forte and you could say that slow infrastructure development is its moat. 



If so, there is still a long way to go for its business to be disrupted by digital tech. Given Harrison fundamentals and a good margin of safety, why wouldn’t you give this a look?

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. 

Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!

I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.

But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.

The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

If it’s a bubble, it’s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

> Among the record-setting elements of Nvidia’s NVDA stunning fiscal fourth quarter was its 76% GAAP gross margin, which was up from 66% a year before. Nvidia forecasts that margin will remain around the same level for its ongoing quarter. 

> Nvidia’s gross margins appear to be the second highest in the semiconductor industry, behind only those of Arm Holdings PLC ARM which licenses chip designs but doesn’t sell its own chips directly. Arm’s gross margins were roughly 93% in the December quarter. 

> Nvidia’s margins stand out among those elsewhere in the chip sector. Intel Corp. INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter

> Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark.

Eaxecx,"A Simple Test Showing why the Dollar is Valuable while Bitcoin is Worthless
",1708584652,1awzywt,0,1,"Suppose you're an infinitely rich person and you bought all the dollars and bitcoins in circulation. Question: what can you do with them without selling them back to someone on the market?

Let's start with dollars. The Dollar is debt owed to banks. Individuals and companies owe it to commercial banks based on loans, while the government ows it to the Federal Reserve based on bonds. So with your dollars, you can go to the banks that that created them by issuing loans, and repay those loans. Meaning, you can make millions and millions of people happy by releasing liens on their movable or immutable property. Also, you can pay principals and coupons on government bonds purchased by the Federal Reserve and thus, make taxpayers happy.

Let's now go to Bitcoin. So you bought all the Bitcoin supply, i.e.,19.63 million bitcoins. You bought scarce, decentralized, fast, and secure tokens. What can you do with them? Well, literally and absolutely nothing. If you manage to find that anonymous guy Satoshi Nakamoto who issued them via his protocol, he won't be able to make masses of people happy by doing something beneficial to them like in the case of the Dollar. Bitcoin is not issued as debt. So, you're left with just watching the number 19.63 million on the screen. You have something that literally everyone can have in an instant by pressing keys on a keyboard.

And that is why the Dollar it's valuable while Bitcoin is worthless.",investing,0.17,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awzywt/a_simple_test_showing_why_the_dollar_is_valuable/

I watched an Alex Hormozi video and he said the first 100k is the hardest because your mindset is stuck on ""how can I make 100k"" and that makes you come up with solutions that involve trading time for money. And then once you surpass 100k you think ""how can I make 10 mil"" which involves thinking outside of trading time for money because there are not enough hours in a lifetime to sell 10 million dollars worth of hours.

Bubbly_Ad5516,IRA Withdrawals to Pay Off Debt: What Are the Penalties?,1722030691,1ed000b,0,4,"I have a question about my IRA-Edge and Roth IRA-Edge accounts with Merrill. Currently, I have $3,820.39 in my IRA-Edge and $509.98 in my Roth IRA. I’m considering withdrawing this money to pay off some old lingering debt. The amount I owe on this charged-off debt is roughly around that total (after negotiating it down).

I know there are often mixed opinions about whether to pay off old debt or keep the money invested. However, I’m focused on improving my credit score, so I’m leaning towards paying off the debt. With that in mind, what are the penalties for early withdrawal from both my Roth IRA and IRA-Edge accounts? I’m 28 and based in Michigan.

Once this debt is settled, I plan to resume investing in my retirement accounts. For now, it feels like clearing this debt is a more immediate priority. I’d appreciate any insights or advice!

* I always done bare min for the match in the 401k, and now I'm near 10%. Default stuff and SP500 related
* About 5-6 years ago I started a dividend portfolio in a taxable account. Started off as a yield chaser, REIT lover and now more blue chip dividends payers. 
* I have 2 (very young) kids that i opened up 2 separate taxable accounts, only VTI. I didn't do 529 because well college isn't a guarantee. 

  
I was very much on the dividend portfolio kick. I enjoyed every step of the way hitting $100/year, $1000/year, $100/month. Now i'm about $4k/year with $100k invested. 

  
But honestly i've just lost interest. I still fund the account but now it's sitting in cash earning 5%. But honestly, i don't want to research stocks anymore or i easily get distracted.

Serraph105,Are HSA's (Health Savings account) technically a scam?,1721937091,1ec4739,0,1,"So, hear me out, HSA's are (for those that don't know) basically a 401k account for health expenses only, except that the money you put in is never taxed, not on the way in, nor when it's withdrawn and since it can be invested it grows, also tax free, over time. Here's the  rub that I see. Most places only allow a person to get and contribute to an HSA when they take the high deductible medical plan. These are the plans that allow you to contribute a very low amount towards health insurance under the assumption that you likely will not need to use it, but if you do end up needing to use it, you will end up having to pay a very large amount. Where is that money likely coming from? The HSA of course. Ideally, you don't have to draw it out until after retirement, but it's not set up in a way where you can responsibly count on that, right?

As we know, short positions require more conviction and are more likely to be a made by a sophisticated investor, as they are borrowing money to keep the position open. Research has also shown that investors engaging in short selling typically focus on valuations and fundamentals more than the average investor.

I was wondering if any of you guys use short interest as a metric to value stocks and if you do not, what are you thoughts?

For example: not opening a position on stocks with more than 5% short interest.

BeginnerInvestor,Does anyone have a theory on why electric utilities (like $VPU) have been a lousy investment?,1707620837,1anxzjh,0,43,"Does anyone have a theory/understanding as to why electric utilities (or a basket of them like $VPU) have been a lousy investment historically?  
VPU in Last 5 years has returned 4.85%. 
  
Yes, electricity demand has been mostly stagnant in the past couple of decades (1-2% increase annually). However, considering that it is so timely and costly to construct power plants (for example, 5-8 years long from permitting to construction in CA), labor intensive, running power plants and distributing & transmitting electricity and guaranteed profit margins through rate increases - one would have thought it would have some premium.  
  
Secondly, what about from now into the future? 
AI is going to introduce a step-change function in electricity demand, raising multiple challenges around maintaining the electric grid while at the same time transitioning to cleaner energy. For example, compared to residential power consumption by city, Nvidia's H100 chips would rank as the 5th largest just behind Houston, Texas. [1]  
It is forecasted that by 2027 A.I. servers could use between 85 to 134 terawatt hours (Twh) annually. That's similar to what Argentina consumes annually. [2].

Are we going to see a re-rating of utilities eventually?

-She is 60 and currently working. 
-No 401k or retirement accounts.
-No savings. 
-Car almost paid off and running fine. 
-Unsure of debt or living expenses at this time. 

Inheritance is $200,000. Accounts are with an investment firm and appear to be well diversified, however the majority is not invested in stocks or funds that I would expect to see much growth from.  

Normally at her age it would make sense to move money into less ""risky"" places, which in my experience tends to mean, moving it into funds that have slower growth, but are less likely to crash with the market. However, considering she's already getting by without this, (ilbeit barely) I would prefer to see this invested a little more aggressively for the next 5 to 10 years to try and maximize it's potential and hopefully allow her to fully retire. 

When I say aggressively, I'm thinking something like S&P500 funds. Like VFIAX, SWPPX, VOO, and SPY. I figure she's more likely to see meaningful growth in her last 10 working years if this money is entirely invested in the S&P500, at which point it can be switched to dividend / interest based positions to supplement her social security income, and hopefully allow full retirement around 70.

**Performance & Growth History**

Since its IPO in 1986 at $753, MKL has skyrocketed, delivering a 20,000% return. They have a well-managed stock portfolio valued at $99.6 billion by the end of 2023, with a decent return of 21.6% on investments last year alone. In true buffet fashion they are an insurance business that allocates its float towards high return investments. ([more insights here](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/MKL/insights))



**Investing Philosophy**



1. Investing in good businesses with solid returns on capital.
2. Partnering with management teams that display talent and integrity.
3. Identifying companies with reinvestment opportunities for sustainable growth.
4. Buying at fair prices.



They are obviously very focused on shareholder returns.



**Valuation Insights**

After digging into their most recent financials, the intrinsic value of MKL’s shares is estimated at $1,931. Currently, the stock trades at $1,603 — suggesting an 18% margin of safety.

Traditional-Jump6145,Molina Healthcare (MOH) 10X'd in 10 yrs. Will this continue?,1728670954,1g1ghfl,0,1,"Health insurance has not really been talked about at all during this presidential election, and I'm not sure what that means for health insurance industry.



Molina, specifically, seems like a good company to look at because of their fundamentals. And here are the key points that caught my attention.



Molina Healthcare is primarily focusing on providing Medicaid, Medicare, and other government-funded health insurance programs. Projected growth rates for both Medicare and Medicaid expenses—7.4% and 5.2% annually, respectively, until 2032. 



The suggestions is that as enrollment increases, the number of individuals relying on these programs will also rise, creating a substantial tailwind for Molina’s business. It's projected that by 2030, about 60% of the eligible Medicare population will be enrolled, which could lead to significant revenue increases for the company.



Looking at the company’s performance over the years, it’s impressive to see that Molina's stock price has increased about [tenfold since 2014](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/MOH/general), substantially outperforming the S&P 500. This growth story resonates with the broader trend of increased healthcare spending in the U.S. In recent quarters, Molina's revenue has reached all-time highs, and they experienced a year-over-year revenue growth of 17%. Pretty much in perfect alignment with growth in insurance spending.



An [analysis](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/MOH/analyst) noted that while revenues are climbing, Molina's net income has not mirrored this growth and has even shown a downtrend lately. In the most recent quarter, the company reported earnings of about $1.06 billion. Are margins thinning in the industry?



The company remains optimistic about its future. In their most recent earnings call, they reaffirmed guidance of at least $23.50 in earnings per share for 2024, translating to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 14.7 based on their current share price of $346. This P/E ratio seems reasonable for a company in a growth phase, especially one that operates primarily under government contracts.



The CEO’s positive outlook adds another layer of allure to the investment case. They highlighted Molina's Medicaid and Medicare divisions as strong performers and expressed confidence in their ability to navigate the evolving healthcare landscape. This optimism, paired with governmental support for healthcare, creates a solid foundation for sustained growth.

tutu16463,Discussing investment styles : Compounder bros VS Pod monkeys,1728677647,1g1iyzn,0,7,"Good day, this is meant to be a question, a discussion, a rant, and self-retrospection.   
Context: I received an email regarding an investment competition by my alma mater. It mentions being based on a similar competition launched by Berkshire/Buffet, but I couldn't find any specific info regarding that... Regardless, the objective of the challenge is to construct a portfolio of 20 stocks to be held over an investment period of 20 years. 

My initial reaction to this email was what the fuck are we doing ?

Now, like most non-targets of my generation, I first got interested in stocks via technical analysis and the day-trading lure. And like most, I found out that TA was not for me and moved on ...to options. Then I met a buy-side analyst who explained equity valuation and portfolio management to me and things clicked, I then went and got a finance degree and ended up as a credit analyst. That to say that I went through multiple phases and styles of investing before, Both on a retail/pa perspective, and professionally. Including the typical ""quality companies at good prices"".  

My current style/preference and understanding of how an analyst, PM, firm, and asset manager create and add value is very much aligned with how the ubiquitous multi-manager firms operate. Pooled Alpha generation, low-correlation Sharpe ratios, makes perfect sense to me.

Indexing, low cost Beta, also makes perfect sense to me. Especially in the context of a diversified portfolio including alts or portable alpha, maybe even a 60/40. Obviously, pure arbs and what's closer to market makes sense. Even CTAs and certain momentum factor based strategies, cigar-butts or 52WL digging, turnarounds and cyclical shitcos, etc., etc...

But picking stocks over a 20-years period ? That makes absolutely no sense to me. I don't get what's meant to be taught, or how an analysis that would lead to such a conclusion has any merit whatsoever. What's the modeling here, what mispricing are we deriving, how's it hedged ?   
And why are we having a competition based on a firm (where that's not even really the strategy?) that employs 5 analysts when Millennium employs 2,500 and have a strong internship program actively looking for candidates ? No wonder such firms don't come to recruit here if we are teaching students to forecast RoE's to infinity based on past performance instead of levering a Beta neutral low vol Sharpe based on the consensus mispricing probability of earnings surprises.

I've interviewed at pods, so I've been more so focused on that perspective as of late, and I'm starting to feel like I've almost forgotten the ""quality companies at no matter the price with low turnover"" philosophy. And what I remember doesn't make as much sense to me anymore... I didn't get the job though, so I could be regarded, and  I do feel like I'm in the bell curve meme right now. Maybe when I will mature as an investor, I will unlock the fable promise land of ""just buy good companies"".

But, right now, I would trust a CMT more than someone that tells me that he invests for 20-years, that's beyond astrology, that's crystals healing.... Pitch me on the latter ? Compound pill me ?

Technical-Stage-8894,Lump Sum vs. Dollar-Cost Averaging? Seeking Advice on Strategy to Invest Windfall,1727642516,1fse88i,0,1,"I’ve recently come into some cash that I’d like to put into the market, and I’m looking for advice on the best strategy. The funds are in two currencies: 9,000 USD and 35,000 CAD. Here’s my plan so far:

* **$20,000 CAD** will go into a HYSA as my emergency fund.
* I’m planning to invest the remaining into my TFSA: **$9,000 USD** into VTI and **$15,000 CAD** into XGRO.

Since this is the most I’ve ever invested at once, I’m a bit hesitant about the strategy. My current plan is to invest a lump sum of 50-75% of the available cash and then dollar-cost average (DCA) the rest over the next 1-6 months.

A few questions for the community:

* Does a lump-sum strategy make sense, or should I lean more toward DCA given current market conditions?
* Any thoughts on the VTI and XGRO allocation?  Should I consider adding other ETFs to diversify more? 

Would appreciate any feedback from those with more experience, especially with lump-sum vs. DCA strategies.

Since then I noticed a lot of inconsistencies on the results. For some random stocks I got 0 data, for others the market cap was all wrong etc.

Decided to check alternatives as I also wanted to get more and more data (ratios, multiples etc.) to finalize a personal valuation assessment tool / formula.

Came across Yahoo Finance API but it's a lot of work to do and pretty unstable.

Searching a little bit more I found the FMP API. It has a Free Tier and paid plans. Free Tier offers 250 calls per day. Starter Tier offers 300 calls per minute but costs about 20$ monthly if you pay per year.

With the free tier and considering NYSE, NASDAQ, NYSEAMERICAN exchanges (~6000 stocks), and by optimising the code, i may need to run the API daily for 4-5 days to get the full update on everything. It doesn't bother me as the daily changes are nowhere near ""value investing"", just eant your opinion on this and your experience eith it.

One of them looks like it could be to bring capital gains tax aligned with income tax. So any gains over £50k would be subject to 40% tax and anything below £50k is 20% tax. Student loans would be charged at 9% above £2k for any gains outside of employment. Let's say I bought 500 Apple stock or a Dow Jones etf that were both priced at 200 dollars in the year 2024($100k investment). And by the year 2040, both the stock and the etf are now priced at 2000. So my investment is now worth $1 million. However, 49% of the net $900k gain would be subject to capital gains tax and student loans(almost $450k). This doesn't even take into account foreign exchange and currency risk. 

Fine, I decide I will never sell my investments and leave it to future children. Inheritance tax is 40% and the new government is set to make a raft of changes to collect more inheritance tax.

gauravphoenix,Some questions I ask before investing,1726955102,1fmdqw1,0,6,"I am writing my thoughts down in the hopes of helping fellow investors. 

---

**Is it easy to think about the company?**

Find out how many reporting segments are there. The lesser, the better, the ideal being one. More reporting segments mean more complexity. Avoid conglomerates for the same reason: they are too complex to evaluate. The fewer the moving parts, the more accurate you can be in your judgments. For example, when evaluating Amazon, are you evaluating Amazon as a retail company? What would it look like without the cloud infra (AWS) business? 

Sometimes, it does make sense to have more segments *when the company has matured*- in this case, it is okay so long you can see operational leverage through multiple segments. 

Essentially, you are asking the question- is it a simple business? 

**How does the company make money?** 

First, understand the industry at large. Read books if available. Watch YouTube videos (e.g., CEO interviews). Contact friends and family to see if they know someone in the industry. Use Reddit. Do whatever it takes, but gain some conceptual understanding of the industry. 

What would prevent the company from having more revenues next year? There could be many reasons, such as

1. More competition—no company will ever say it is losing customers due to competition, so you need to figure it out for yourself. Ideally, you want some competition as it proves there is indeed demand, but you don’t want too much either. If there is indeed too much competition (a large number of smaller players), give preference to the large companies as they are likely more resilient.

1. Less demand is expected for cyclical industries during their down phase; there’s nothing wrong with that. The most important thing to evaluate here is the chance that demand will return and that the company will be ready to capture it (through long-term contracts, brand recognition, monopoly, etc.). Also, look for industry-specific concerns here, e.g. Will there be more tobacco consumers in the future or less? And dig deeper into whether the current problems are overblown (e.g., oil demand). 

For b2c companies, evaluate whether customer behavior can change. A shoe or clothing company will be in fashion every few years, and then it goes away. Remember AllBirds? If the company is doing well due to a trend, think about what will happen when the trend goes away—will it be able to capture the new trend? 

I do not prefer companies that need a lot of R&D (and luck)—e.g., drug makers. It doesn't matter how much money you have; the chances of your drug becoming available to customers are more of a matter of luck. Patents in the pharmaceutical industry help only for so long, given the long development cycle.

1. Regulations & geopolitics: Does the company enjoy the current set of regulations, and what will happen when the tailwinds go away? For example, Green energy companies enjoy cheap money. When inflation goes up, the government can’t keep funding such initiatives. Or perhaps the political climate could change. 

**What does it take to make the money?** 

Dig deeper into COGS. As the revenue goes up, COGS will go up too, but look for permanent(structural) issues. For example, $HSY has been having bad times lately due to the high price of cocoa. But these are temporary issues; the cost of cocoa will come down. As the African regions are having problems, farmers in Brazil are rushing to take advantage of high cocoa prices. Chocolate companies will have more diversity in the future, and current dependency on the African region should be reduced. #anti-fragile 

The critical thing to look at here (depending on the industry) is the diversity of suppliers. You do not want your sole supplier to jack up the price. And if that happens, can you pass the increased costs to consumers? $GIS recently said they can’t raise the price anymore, impacting their recent results. Such issues are okay so long as you think they are temporary. If $GIS increased ",ValueInvesting,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fmdqw1/some_questions_i_ask_before_investing/

gorngoblo,Really SCARY realization I just had about investing,1708312777,1aud7w5,0,1,"Investing is just one letter away from incesting! Try it yourself don’t just take me for my word — replace the v in investing with a c and look at the results. What does this mean for both the S&P 500 and international stocks?



My personal take is, for the S&P 500, the implications of this linguistic exercise serve as a reminder of the need for due diligence and careful consideration when allocating capital. While the S&P 500 is often regarded as a benchmark for the overall health of the U.S. stock market, it is not immune to volatility or market downturns. Investors should avoid blindly following trends or succumbing to herd mentality, instead opting for a diversified portfolio and a long-term investment strategy.

Similarly, international stocks may offer opportunities for growth and diversification, but they also come with their own set of risks and challenges. Factors such as geopolitical instability, currency fluctuations, and regulatory changes can all impact the performance of international investments. By approaching international markets with the same level of scrutiny and discernment as domestic ones, investors can better position themselves to navigate the complexities of the global economy.

In essence, the juxtaposition of ""investing"" and ""incesting"" serves as a metaphor for the importance of responsible decision-making in the realm of finance. Just as one letter can change the meaning of a word, one ill-advised investment can have far-reaching consequences for an individual's financial well-being.

It aims to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  
The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering (IPO) price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors.  
The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at about $10 billion in a funding round in 2021, did not immediately respnd to Reuters request for comment.  
Reuters in January reported that Reddit has drawn up detailed plans for its IPO in March. It had filed confidentially for its IPO back in December 2021.  
The IPO market has not yet fully recovered as it has been struggling for the last two years with low volumes while several new entrants trade below their IPO prices.  
Reddit's IPO, which has been in the works for more than three years now, would be the first from a major social media company since Pinterest's debut in 2019.

nerdy_harmony,Questions about 401k Breakdown,1708612450,1ax7twb,0,1,"Hi all- I have a couple questions about my 401k. To start with, there's the breakdown:

Employee Pre-Tax: 100% vested (7k)


Employer non-elective: 0% vested (5k)


Safe Harbor Match: 100% vested (7k)


The 401k is put into the Vanguard Target Retire 2060 Trust 1 and it through Empower (previously Prudential) and I'm contributing 6% pre-tax. My employer match should also be 6%. 


My questions are as follows:
1) What is the safe harbor match?  

2) Is the 2060 Trust 1 a good investment to be putting my 401k into?

I opened a betterment Roth IRA in 2019. It was an easy option for me as I didn’t have to learn too much about what to invest into. First couple of years I maxed out, last two I haven’t been able to because of a career change. Overall it’s doing well, averaging about 10% a year. 

But I’m starting to wonder if it’s best for the long term like when I retire. Has anyone retired with one of these accounts yet? Have you been completely fucked with fees or bad returns? And any recommendations on where to move the money too that is not a robo investor!

Falconhurst,Motley Fool 10x Discovery Service 2020-2021 analysis as of July 2024,1722047147,1ed5ono,0,1,"Today I found an old investment folder with recommendations of the Motley Fool 10x Discovery Service from when I was subscribed to their “All Access” pass that cost about $7000 (mid-2020 to mid-2021).  Despite the hype about outperforming the market, the Fool’s recommendations performed poorly for me and I discontinued the service. 

To see what I had “missed out” on if I had held for the several-year timeline they recommend, I referenced the price of each stock at a midpoint in my subscription (arbitrarily selected at Jan 4 or 5, 2021) and today (July 26, 2024). Here are the results.

I was not able to find an exact price for Hedosophia IV (IPOD) in Jan 2021 as the SPAC shuttered in 2022, but it was also for a loss compared to the recommended price.

Motley Fool 10x Discovery: -50.25% average return for the other 29 recommendations over this period.

S&P 500: 45.65% return (3,748.14 to 5,459.1)

NASDAQ: 36.69% return (12,698.45 to 17,357.88)

Motley Fool 10x Discovery vs. S&P 500: -92.45%

Motley Fool 10x Discovery vs NASDAQ: -83.50%

Out of the 30 Motley Fool 10x Discovery recommendations, only 5 did not lose money. 10 recommendations lost 80% or more, with 3 falling to zero. Despite the claim of the “10x Discovery Service” to identify putative future “ten-baggers,” none of the stocks approached this return. At 18-22% inflation since January 2021, three of the five non-loss positions lost ground or were stagnant in inflation-adjusted returns (Live Oak Bankshare 0.29% return, CrowdStrike 20.93%, and Walker Dunlop at 21.93%). Only two had positive inflation-adjusted returns: Bitcoin (99.95%) and Kinsale Capital Group (122.1%).

The Fool’s 30 recommendations were overwhelmingly cash flow negative stocks with poor fundamentals. Nonetheless, their various services doubled down, for instance recommending Fiverr (FVRR) three times at over $200 within a four-month period. It sells for $22.72 today. While these recommendations did not discover any 10x returns, they did discover 1/10th returns. Lemonade (LMND) was another repeat recommendation across multiple Motley Fool services. It has fallen over 80% and continues to lose over $200 million annually with no clear pat",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ed5ono/motley_fool_10x_discovery_service_20202021/

I took $1k to 5800 in my trading account and I realized, thats cool and Ill continue to grind, but over those 3 years I wouldve already had 21k had I started earlier instead of trading. And funnier is if VT was down 20% id still have 3x my trading account money. 

So Dollar cost averaging in is my way

Starks-Technology,The absolute best way to search for new stocks in 2024,1707512256,1amygd1,0,1,"**Non-Technical Guide**

Imagine you wanted to create 3 different portfolios. They are as follows:

* Invest in the top 3 pharmaceutical stocks with the largest incomes with a market cap below $500 million
* Short the top 7 AI Stocks that were not profitable and had the lowest revenue increases in the past 6 months
* Buy the top 3 AI/Semiconductor stocks with the largest increase income in the past 5 years with a market cap below $200 billion

How would you go do your research? Would you use Google? ChatGPT? Your brokerage? How do you aim to find the specific stocks that fits your investment thesis?

The reality is that none of these sources will help much. Google isn't not going to tell you which stocks have the largest incomes or the lowest revenue increases. Similarly, ChatGPT isn't trained to execute these complex user queries.

Then obviously, your brokerage isn't going to help you. They want you to buy the stocks that are at 52 week highs or are ""daily gainers"". The reason for this is simple: your brokerages want you to execute trades so they make money. Making it easy to find objective information doesn't align with their business goals, so they're not going to invest in that.

However, I recently designed a way to perform this intelligent stock searching using Large Language Models. The way it works is that you start by populating a database full of all of the company information (like if a stock is a pharmaceutical stock vs an AI stock vs a semiconductor stock, etc.) Then, you populate your database full of fundamental data across time, that being revenue, income, price, market cap, PE ratio, and what other metrics you want to search for.

Finally, you will utilize the power of a Large Language Model. The LLM will convert the plain English query into a format that can intelligently search for the data in the database. Specifically, you'll use [function-calling](https://www.promptingguide.ai/applications/function_calling) and [few-shot prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot) to generate a SQL query or a MongoDB aggregation pipeline.

Combined, you'll be able to search for stocks that meets your investment goals using natural language! This is extremely powerful. Want to see what biopharmaceutical stocks are actually profitable? Easy! Want to see which airlines are increasing their income each year? Piece of cake! Essentially, you can find **anything** you want to look for in a stock, which allows you to more easily create a basket of stocks for your algorithmic trading strategies!

**Technical Guide**

If you're more interested in the **exact implementation**, I wrote up an entire article for you. It's well worth the read! 

I plan to implement this architecture for myself over the weekend! In the meantime, I'd love to get some overall feedback on this approach. I feel like traders aren't using LLMs like they should, but they are extremely powerful. We've really yet to realize their full potential in finance, and I'd also like to hear about other awesome use-cases you guys can think of.",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1amygd1/the_absolute_best_way_to_search_for_new_stocks_in/

Synseer83,Should I change my 401k/457 Contribution Percentage?,1707778418,1apdn05,0,3,"Hi everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster. As the title says I'm looking/thinking about changing my Contribution Percentage in my 401k and 457, but I figured I'd ask/get everyones insight before I do (or even if i should)

A bit of context. I work for NYC in a job that pays very well ($101k before OT). I currently contribute 6.5% to my 401k and another 6.5% to my 457. I know theres no way im im maxing both of those funds but I've been thinking about trying to max atleast one of them and lowering my contribution in the other significantly. Or should i just increase each to 10/11%? 

I also pay into my Pension so there's unfortunately no Employer match.

While it would be a hit to my take home every two weeks, its essentially offset by my VA Compensation (100% P&T). Thats an additional $50,500/year which is tax free ($4,202 every month).

I also opened a brokerage account last week with Vanguard after noticing my VA money was sitting in a MMSA with a paltry 1.10% APY. Plan is to take half of what ive got ($75k) and park it in Vanguard for the default sweep (VMFXX 5.27% APY) or put it in VUSXX (5.29% APY) for the state tax benefit. Im just waiting for Vanguard to officially open it before i start that. 

While i was at it, i also opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard and maxed 2023 and 2024 last week. I do feel like im overlapping between my 401k and Roth (actually i know i am, i just dont know what funds to split or allocate to). I plan on maxing it out every year. 

For Reference here is what I have, allocation wise, in each account:

401k - $32,050.80 - 6.5% Contribution 
Large Cap Growth - 75.18%
Global/Intl - 16.57%
Bond - 8.25%

457 - $30,006.38 - 6.5% Contribution 
2040 TDF - 68.88%
2045 TDF - 31.12%

Roth IRA - $13,584.87
VTI - 60%
VXUS- 20%
BND - 20%

Secondly, should i rebalance/restructure my 401k/457? Choose different funds to target/allocate my contributions to?

Forgot to mention, 15 years to be eligible for retirement (22 Year Plan). I don't have an HSA or a 529 due to the benefits my family and myself get from being 100% P&T thru the VA.

HarveyHomelander,QQQM versus FNGS Allocation,1707430639,1am7y23,0,1,"If you were going to include both QQQ and FNGS in your portfolio, how would you balance them? 

Assume I’m not looking to include individual stocks so for my tech-specific exposure, so I have included both QQQM and FNGS. (Also, just to get ahead of it, I fully understand that FNGS is an ETN owned by BMO and I fully appreciate the risks that come with that type of vehicle.) 

That being said, I am currently very heavy in my allocation towards QQQM but am seeking to “diversify” the concentration of my tech sector exposure while still keeping it mainly broad mega-cap. Specifically, QQQM’s current weighting is 9% MSFT, 8% Apple, 5% Amazon, 5% Nvidia, while FNGS’s current weighting is 13% Meta, 12% Tesla, 11% Nvidia, 10% AMD. 

While I understand that given the number of similar holdings and the sector correlation means their beta won’t be significantly different, given the recent concentration in certain components’ movement, I want to make sure I have the opportunity to capture any additional alpha produced by such weightings (QQQM’s 11% annual return since 2020 vs FNGS’s ~18%). 

My thought is that given how heavily SPY/VOO are weighted towards MSFT/AAPL, it may be worth apportioning a significant part to FNGS in order to up my Meta/Tesla/AMD exposure (the latter two’s performance last week aside). Not a fan of how heavily FNGS weights Netflix but I guess that comes with the territory.",investing,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1am7y23/qqqm_versus_fngs_allocation/

1. They have the privilege of learning from Tesla's mistakes when it comes to EV manufacturing  
  
2. The product is incredible and is familiar enough to pull the range rover / escalade crowd over to EV  
  
3. When comparing Rivian to Tesla, I am looking at production volume. At the number of cars Rivian is producing, tesla was losing way more money  
  
4. customer satisfaction: 9/10 Rivian drivers say that they will buy another rivian. this is almost Apple levels of stickiness.  
  
5: According to Minno Finance, in 2025 revenue will grow by at least 25% on an annual basis compared to 2024 estimates, but when taking into account for reported revenue so far, it will grow 18.45%. Additionally, Rivian projects that by Q4 they will actually be generating a positive gross profit per vehicle.

  
6. This is the one thing that no one is talking about: Acquirability. Rivian's customer demographic is what every legacy automaker is trying to go for, and with a product as strong as the R1 Lineup and VW's joint venture, I think that aside from the underlying financials, the quality of Rivian's products make them an easy target if things do go south.

jeywhat,I want to ask what rules makes the US stock market,1726587650,1fj2he3,0,6,"Hi. I'm Korean Investor, 25 years old, been investing for 5 years now. 

I started learning investing and company analyzing at the college value investing club, and then did some internships at the firms local in korea. 

In korea, what I learned by fighting in the stock market, the best investing/trading way that fits was kind of momentum trading and growth investing combined. Expecting next quarter or next years earnings, and finding some tradeable informations that are not widespread(tiktok trends, instagram trends or so on), and search for future events and anticipate the results for that. 

Nowadays I'm trying to move to US stocks, and I want to do the same playbook here, but before starting to do like that, I just wanted to know what formula rules the market. 

In korea It was definitely fper(forward per)-becomes-cheap logic. when some company grows, lets say for example the company that sells buldak - samyang foods, will earn much more OP(operating margins) than 1 years ago by the ramen exports increase and leverage effect - so the stock price went 10X. 

I'd guess this rules fits for every stock market, but also there might be more. In US I heard, and by reading some reddit articles and talking to them, Cash Flows might be the important one. 

And for one more, what thing do you spend most of your time to? For me, I spend lots of time updating quarterly results, traking trends, organize some possibly-related future events. I do not actually spend time for screening - rather, I just try to study one sector and its related companies. 

But I want to hear more indicators or criteria while investing, and want to hear what is the most ime-consuming job in your process. Feel free to talk with me or Chat with me is fine! I want to hear some various ways you invest, and want to get some advice on my ways too.

DW_Rafi,If a mutual fund's market rate is less than it's NAV is it a good idea to double my already existing holdings?,1727011235,1fmt48v,0,1,"I'm pretty new to investing and been around in the stock market for 2.5 years or so....

I initially bought some Mutual fund's from the secondary market when i saw the units were being traded under their NAV. Everything was great. Also received around 14% dividend yield in 2022 & about 9% in 2023..

However In 2024 the entire market index (DSEX) declined almost 40%. So did my mutual fund's... i picked up some at 30% discount but on avg my holdings ar still down by 15%.

Since the market hasn't recovered yet and The Mutual fund's are reporting a negative EPS in the 3rd quarter, I'm pretty sure there won't be any dividends this year.

But the NAV per mutual fund unit is still almost 1.5x the market price of those units.


For example: This Mutual fund is being traded at Tk. 4.2/unit and it's weekly asset value is given below:

""On the close of operation on September 19, 2024, the Fund has reported Net Asset Value (NAV) of Tk. 8.73 per unit on the basis of current market price and Tk. 11.15 per unit on the basis of cost price against face value of Tk. 10.00.

Total Net Assets of the Fund stood at Tk. 1,957,394,642.00 on the basis of current market price and Tk. 2,501,369,935.00 on the basis of cost price after considering all assets and liabilities of the Fund.""

Nobody seems to buy those at such a low discounted price. Am I missing something here? I'm thinking about doubling my holdings in those mutual funds after I sell of individual stocks that ate slightly in profit or are at break even point. Is this a reasonable approach?

OMGQuantiSoldi_,American Express - Low ROIC? Free Cashflow Calculation?,1727014995,1fmug4t,0,3,"Hello Everyone, so I will take for granted that everyone here is well aware of the fact that AMEX is Berkshire's 2nd largest holding by value and that Buffet through the years has made many remarks to the virtues of the company and its place in the competitive Credit Card sector. I wanted to look into the company as a Case Study as one of Buffet's largest investments, but I have had many difficulties with calculation of its Return on Invested Capital and its free cashflow. 

***Part 1 - Issues with ROIC***

The main issue that I can't get a hold of is how can the ROIC for such a company be calculated. Differently from Visa and Mastercard, the company is not solely a credit card network operator but an issuer and an acquirer. And from my understanding, AMEX unlike Visa and MC issues lines of credit, which are essentially loans to the cardholder. Additionally (or maybe I should say simultaneously), customers hold deposits with AMEX and the company pays a certain return on their deposits.

In the way I think about it, AMEX carries both these loans (Asset side) and deposits (liabilities side) on their balance sheet, and as consequence has an Invested Capital which is highly inflated. Therefore it has a far smaller ROIC in comparissons to its ""pure network"" competitors. From my attempt at calculating ROIC and from my rather rudimentary if not silly calculation I find it to be around 5%. Which seems extremely low considering that Buffet's primary definition of a wonderfull business is one that can keep emploing capital at a high ROIC. 

I am surely missing something, and feel free to flame me for it.  - Should deposits not be considered part of the company's invested capital? - What about loans on the asset side? - Am I thinking about the company in a completely wrong way? 

For reference: 

* Visa has a Return on Assets of around 19% while AMEX is at 3%.
* In 2023 AMEX had arounf $120 Billion of Loans to card holders on the asset side, and 129 Billion $ in customer deposits on the Liabilities side.

***Part 2 - Issues with FCF***

For the same reasons I have had difficulty in calculating the company's free cashflows. The company's free cashflows from operations are preetty straight forward, however because a large part of it's credit card activity is lending I tend to think of the company as more similar to a bank. Does anyone maybe have any insight on this? I read prof. [Aswath Damodaran's paper on the valuation of financial services firm ](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/finfirm09.pdf)but again I'm not really sure where AMEX truly stands between a lending istitution and a credit card company. As a consquence it is not clear to me how it's free cashflow could be calculated and how the company could be valued.

MrAccord,Discussion On Time (Investor's Greatest Resource),1727018796,1fmvvit,0,2,"Presumably, most of us are young (35 or younger), and so we have long runways of tied to accumulate wealth and let it compound.  Even mediocre picks can grow quite large, better than a high-yield savings account, given enough time.

Yet, this focuses on time in a long sense.  Time is also a valuable resource in the day-to-day.  Some things can be done in days that may take others months, simply because of how well they use their time.  I'll give some examples.

1. **SWBI Trade:**  I don't often do trades, but when I do, I try to make sure they are precise, high-confidence moves.  When the first assassination attempt against Trump was made, which happened on a weekend, I knew it was highly likely that the market would drive up gun stocks.  SWBI was a healthy, well-capitalized business, as well as a famous brand, so I knew it was likely to be one people would be comfortable buying.  I spent about $500 in calls at market open.  Within the hour, I exited with $1,200.  It was perhaps the easiest $700 I ever made.

2. I have a much older friend who is a successful businessman.  His area of expertise is chemical testing, and changes in the regulatory environment have opened the door for a new business opportunity that he is working to set up.  I've had coffee and lunch with him many times, shared some stock insights (some of which have made him money), and over time he's noticed I've picked up on how a good business should be run, so he's including me in this idea.

Both of those were possible because I found a way to become self-employed.  This opened up my schedule to the point that I can pick up almost any and every opportunity that falls before me.  I would be earning more at a typical 9-5 job, but I'd have a lot less time to study potential moves and put myself in front of the right people.

LeBourruBienfaisant,"Lululemon, exploring the concept of economic moat",1727021306,1fmwtmc,0,7,"My fellow Value Investors,



I wanted to share some thoughts about a concept that is of utmost importance, yet highly controversial, in value investing: the ""Economic moat"". Views can in fact often times range from naively mistaking ordinary business traits for moats to outright dismissing any competitive advantage that is not effectively synonymous with “monopoly”.

I am going to use Lululemon as an example, as I have observed in various discussions that many people seem to unfairly label it as a passing fad, with profits poised to be eroded by fierce competition. I believe this criticism is unwarranted and speaks volumes about how quickly people are to flip rocks without even taking the time to actually look at them. I wonder what Peter would say.

  
**The significance of brand power in the apparel market as a durable competitive advantage**

A key trait that sets a truly outstanding company apart from the rest is a durable competitive advantage. This becomes even more crucial in a highly competitive market such as the apparel, where barriers to entry are low and the only asset competitors can't replicate is effectively the brand image. While determining whether an apparel retailer possesses a moat or is merely a passing fad is certainly no easy task, a quantitative analysis of the company can be quite helpful in reaching a verdict.

  
**Lululemon and its peers, a quantitative comparison**

Lululemon faces competition from a range of companies across different segments of the apparel and athleticwear markets, but a comparison of financial figures reveals some key insights: Lululemon stands out with one of the highest profit margins in the industry (i.e. currently above 16%) while constantly maintaining a below-average marketing spend (i.e. below 5% as per latest annual financial report). The inventory turnover ratio is also not meaningfully slower than that of competitors such as Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour, especially when premium pricing and store count expansion at a 6% CAGR are considered.

Despite intense competition, this company managed to maintain above-average profit margins while consistently growing revenue, EPS, free cash flow, and equity at a significant rate over the last couple of decades, which would suggest that it is not being bothered much by competitors. Either it’s the longest-lasting fad in the industry’s history, or the brand does actually possess some kind of edge that justifies its premium pricing.

  
**A powerful brand with a well-crafted business strategy**

One notable aspect of Lululemon is that it very rarely discounts, as most customers are willing to pay full price. This is quite uncommon in the retail market and highlights not only the strength of its products but also the loyalty of the customers the company has attracted into its ecosystem.

Additionally, as a vertical retailer, Lululemon has greater control over its inventory and production cycles, thus mitigating the pressure to rapidly discount to clear out old-season collections. The DTC model adopted by the company also further enhances control over product quality, boosts supply chain efficiency, provides greater flexibility and responsiveness to market trends, and it ensures a consistent brand experience. Nike's attempt to expand its DTC sales, only to reverse course due to execution challenges and shifting market dynamics, underscores both the potential benefits of this model and the complexities involved in its implementation.

It is also worth noting that the company’s marketing strategy is remarkably distinct from the typical approach of high-profile endorsements with athletes and celebrities, as it prioritizes community engagement and emphasizes a lifestyle rather than just products. And given that some even go so far as to describe the customer base as cult-like, it’s pretty clear that such marketing strategy is highly effective in cultivating a strong and enduring brand identity.

When we look for ""wonderful stocks"" to hold for the long term, understanding the **business itself** is really important.

I'm curious, what difficulties do you face when trying to understand the **business side** of a company you like?

* Is it hard to figure out how the company makes money?
* Do you struggle to see what makes the company better than others (its competitive edge)?
* Is it overwhelming to understand the industry and where the company fits in?
* Is judging the quality of management and their future plans tough?
* Do you find it hard to guess future growth based on the business basics?
* **Or do you not focus on this and find the financial numbers or valuations more important?**

I know ocean freight rates wildly fluctuate and differ from route to route and getting a quote would be the best way to go about it. However, I wish to calculate an estimate based on the Baltic Dry Index.   


So, I need ship lithium ore from India to China. This is I have gone about it.   
The Baltic Capemax Index is $2448 ([https://in.investing.com/indices/baltic-capesize](https://in.investing.com/indices/baltic-capesize))   
Average Capemax Ship is 156,000 DWT ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baltic\_dry\_index.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baltic_dry_index.asp))   
It takes 12 days from Chennai to Shenzen ([https://www.oyeexpress.com/in/transit-time-from-china-india.php#:\~:text=India%20to%20China%20exports%20or,for%20a%20Full%20Container%20Load.)](https://www.oyeexpress.com/in/transit-time-from-china-india.php#:~:text=India%20to%20China%20exports%20or,for%20a%20Full%20Container%20Load.))   
So, my calculation for per tonne cost is 2448\*12/156000. This coming down to a really low $0.2 per tonne.   


I am trying to understand where my method is wrong. Because from what I understand, Baltic Capemax is the average cost of hiring a ship per day of a Capemax size (avg. 156000).

I've been monitoring the TLT day, week, and monthly chart. Today was a weekly close which was not a great look at all. 

a Falling TLT prices could signal inflation expectations or concerns about future economic growth. This might lead to increased volatility in the stock market as investors reassess their risk tolerance and adjust their investments 

A falling TLT can signal expectations of higher interest rates, which could increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Higher interest rates can slow down economic growth and corporate profitability, which may negatively affect stock prices

jonsnowwithanafro,"If the best strategy to make money is to buy and hold an index fund, who is keeping the market “efficient”?",1708528351,1aweeqt,0,74,"I always hear that actively managed funds (and individuals) fail to beat indexes such as the S&P 500. If this is the case, how does the market stay efficient when instead of needing to research companies based on their fundamentals, capital just flows into the top 500 companies with no regard to whether or not they are actually good companies?

It seems to me like the following two things cannot be true at the same time:

1. The market will efficiently price individual companies based on their ability to gain value.

2. The best way for capital to gain value is to buy and hold an index that reflects the market and is agnostic to individual companies. 

Eventually, if point #2 holds true, actively managed funds will become weaker and weaker, until everybody is just pouring money into market indexes. 

If point #1 holds true, then it seems like the entire modern investing paradigm of “you can’t beat the market” is wrong. Perhaps actively managed funds will beat the market in the VERY long run, even if most of them have failed to do so in the last couple decades.

It's already happened to me twice over the last month where I was up about 3k on my existing VOO and then the market tanked and I lost most of my gains. Hopefully this idea will help reduce the negative impact. 

As of right now the stocks that I am eyeing to invest the other half of my current VOO in would be IHG, AWI, VST, and CRH. Once these get stopped out from the trailing stop losses that I set then I would reevaluate whether to add them back in or screen new stocks to replace them with that are at least beating VOO over the long term.

gunnergolfer22,How to practically rebalance my accounts?,1722383048,1eg8i5y,0,1,"Hey all, 30 y/o single dentist here recently out of residency and trying to devise a repeatable investing plan. Income is around $220k/year. I'm starting a new job in a few weeks that will give me my first access to a 401k. I save/invest ~70% of my income. Also considering adding AVUV/AVDV to my portfolio but this seems like an additional rebalancing stress that I may not want...

Current accounts and rough values:

Roth IRA: $50,000
HSA: $10,000
Taxable: $75,000

Everything right now is in a roughly 70/30 split of VTI/VXUS. Now that I'm finally going to be earning consistent income, I want to know how to best contribute and rebalance my portfolio, especially the Taxable brokerage as I will be contributing to that every month. I can imagine that it can soon get large enough that it becomes difficult to rebalance thru new contributions, and I don't want to have to sell.

**For taxable, should I:**

a) Just keep my contributions each month at my 70/30 split?

b) Try to rebalance to 70/30 each time I contribute each month via buying?

c) Some combo of these? And what happens when the portfolio gets too large to do this?

**For retirement:**

I max Roth (backdoor) and HSA on the 1st of the year and will also try to do 401k asap. Should I:

d) Buy/sell once a year to get back to the desired ratios?

e) Something else?",investing,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eg8i5y/how_to_practically_rebalance_my_accounts/

I was working in McDonalds for almost 5 years now - absolutely hated my job but had no other choice because like others, we need to find a way to live and put food on the table. 

Been trying to get out of it by doing all sorts - all the way from dropshipping to crypto trading etc and stock market. Can tell you now - the most PROFITABLE has been stockmarket trading, in small caps and more recently options. Here is my journey, in the most simplest form.

I started off with $30k (which was my entire savings) back in 2020 covid era, and went to $50k before loosing it all and hitting rock bottom and even going into depression (I only had $500 to my name at one point). I didn't give up - I kept going. Through $IVP, $ZAPP, $NVDA options and so much more - I managed to get back to $30k in around February time, and with risk management etc, I'm now past $100k, hoping to get to the millions by the end of next year. Hopefully this post will be a bit of hope for someone, or reassurance that it is NOT the end.

I am also not going to claim credit for this entirely. I have been part of a group that taught me risk management, sent me early signals (they told me about $SERV $MIRA etc a day before), and also offered me so much support. It felt like a family.

Nephews,

When I was young my grandfather sent me many books, some of which I took great pleasure reading. I didn’t know at the time that they would shape who I was, and how I saw the world.

I didn’t like all of them, nor will you like all of these. But the more you take in, and the more you understand, the better your life will be.

Being smart and having knowledge doesn’t get you very far without hard work and sacrifice; but hark work and sacrifice without being smart and having knowledge doesn’t get you very far either.

There is no magic answer, but within these books exist some interesting truths about money, life, and success; while also allowing for you to define what that looks like for yourself, because success is different to everyone. For me personally, I seek a mixture of happiness and fulfillment, while financial successes are an appreciated bonus.

You should be aware of what drives you, and what brings you joy and fulfillment, and you should ask yourself what that might be frequently. 

My great grandmother (my grandfather’s mother) used to say,” you can’t put an old head on young shoulders.” I still contemplate what that means, because that meaning has changed as I have grown older. The meaning of many things will change for you as well, as you get older. 

You may not understand what these books are meant to teach you. While you are reading them, you might think that these books are boring, that they don’t come with all the bells/whistles/appurtenances that you expect to receive in your life. You may feel that these books don’t give you the “secret to life”, or the key to success. 

Please allow me to tell you that I felt the same way. Further, I thought I would receive the “key to the city” upon graduation with my bachelor’s degree, and silly enough, I felt that way when I received my Master’s degree too. I have yet to receive the appreciation I felt I was due from either of these accomplishments. 

I started over in my late 20’s, and then 30’s, broke and damn near bankrupt. And then again in my 40’s. I have been kicked while I was down, both metaphorically and literally, multiple times. I have the scars, bank records, and nerve damage in my face to prove it. 

In more than a few ways I am no example to live by, other than ‘what to avoid’ as well as ‘what to do sooner’. At almost 50 years old, having been destitute nearly twice, what I have to share with you is that what is in your head is what will save you. Liking who you are will save you. Getting back up from the pavement is hard, but not getting up ensures you are going to get pummeled by life for the rest of your life, and that’s where you should find your base motivation. You won’t get beat up by life if you keep getting up and keep moving forward.

Don’t be afraid to fail.

 #1 be afraid to quit.

 #2 be afraid to be complacent.

 #3 be afraid to capitulate on what you know to be right and just in your pursuits.

Getting back to the secret of life. Anyone who promises you what that is, or how they can give it to you is selling something, and I can all but guarantee that you can’t buy a shortcut in this world or the next. The only answer to what is going to make you happy and fulfilled is hidden in your own head, and I would almost bet that it is NOT what you think it is right now. 

Wealth isn’t going to make you happy and fulfilled any more than finally getting a date with the prettiest girl you know will. My stepfather used the phrase “Money is like food, too little is bad.. too much is worse”; and truly, money without purpose can bring big problems (just like that super pretty girl can..)

The secret to life is to listen. Listen to the world, to others, to yourself. 

To succeed in life, listen to what the world wants and provide that good or service that people will pay you for handsomely.",investing,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ei7f81/sending_a_box_of_books_and_a_note_to_my_nephews/

At this time their yields seem to be extremely similar with BND sitting at 4.36% SEC Yield and BSV having 4.46% SEC Yield. 

The only risk I can think of is if the FED starts dropping interest rates, causing BND's longer-term bonds locked in at a higher yield being able to hold on the better yields for longer, whereas BSV is going to be more dependent on recent prices?

That being said, I'm actually not sure how BND and BSV (bond ETFs) are managed when it comes to the market selling off bonds and re-allocating to different bonds. Do they frequently re-balance using secondary market?

Summary:

Stitch Fix offers a convenient clothing selection service that encourages style exploration, provides well-fitting clothes for diverse body types, and delivers surprise and inspiration, particularly benefiting busy individuals, those seeking wardrobe overhauls, and people lacking confidence in their styling abilities.

Stitch Fix faces critical challenges with outdated and limited inventory and an AI-driven push risking the erosion of personalized styling, while customers increasingly complain about repetitive, outdated items that undermine the company's core value of surprise and wardrobe expansion.

The CEO's three-pillar turnaround plan—focusing on retail best practices, building a healthier client base, and reimagining the client experience—appears to be misaligned with core issues, prioritizing new client acquisition over loyal customer retention, neglecting critical inventory problems, and splintering efforts on lower-priority improvements.

Stitch Fix should prioritize urgent inventory improvements and involving stylists in clothing design, developing a balanced assortment, adapting AI systems to handle frequent introduction of diverse new items, focusing on loyal customer retention, aligning reporting systems with strategy, using ads for both customer acquisition and specific item sales,, and testing new designs in specific markets before wider release.",ValueInvesting,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ffw9q7/stitch_fix_a_styling_pioneer_lost_its_thread/

AwakeeXD,Is Qualcomm Undervalued?,1726597301,1fj6mwb,0,17,"Currently the stock is trading at around 37% down from its 52 weeks high.

**Liquidity and Efficiency**

* Qualcomm has a Quick Ratio of 1.78. The value is above 1 and higher than it's 5Y Average of 1.57 which means that Qualcomm can easily cover its short-term liabilities.
* Current Ratio of 2.39 indicates good ability to handle short-term debt.
* Inventory Turnover at 2.6 has decreased compared to the 5Y Average of 4.29. In my opinion this is a strategy for building up inventory in anticipation of future demand for their semiconductors and wireless technologies.

**Solvency**

* The company has reduced its reliance on debt financing. Current D/E is 0.59 which is significantly lower than 5Y Average of 1.8.
* Qualcomm is leveraged within bounds with D/A Ratio of 0.30

**Profitability**

* Company shows strong profitability and efficient management with ROA - 17.3%, ROE - 38.9% ,ROIC - 24.1%. 
* Qualcomm maintains good margins : Gross Margin - 55.9%, Net Profit Margin - 23.6%

**Market Prospects**

* Qualcomm is trading at a lower P/E compared to industry peers. Current P/E is 22.3, 5Y Average 24.86 and industry median 28.26.
* P/B of 7.46 is lower than 5Y Average of 13.41.
* Qualcomm’s current dividend yield is 2.03**%**, with a solid 3-year dividend growth rate of 6.45**%.**

TheDutchInvestors,Tesla's Elon Musk doesn't believe in moats?!,1727029002,1fmzqb5,0,1,"Elon Musk famously said, 

>*""Moats are lame.""* 

This might sound bold, but there's more to it. Musk’s argument is simple: traditional defenses, like moats, won't protect a company in the long run. What really matters is how fast you innovate. 

Musk explained: 

>*""If your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation.""*

Tesla’s decision to open its Supercharger network to other electric vehicle brands sparked criticism. Many believed Tesla was giving up a key competitive advantage—its charging infrastructure, which competitors couldn’t easily replicate.

But Musk had a point: in a fast-evolving industry, innovation matters more than old-school advantages.

**Innovation, not static defenses, is the ultimate driver of long-term success.**

# Innovation vs. traditional moats

Tesla’s Supercharger move proves Musk’s belief that innovation trumps protection. When you're playing in a $2.1 trillion market, you have to innovate quickly to stay ahead.

Yet, traditional moats aren't useless. Top automakers like Toyota and Volkswagen have built strong brands. When every competitor has a solid brand, it becomes crucial to have a brand stronger than the rest. Tesla has pulled this off, with a more valuable brand than many of its rivals.

But: the automotive industry is vast. It’s not winner-takes-all. Companies like Toyota and Volkswagen hold market shares of 13.7% and 12.2%, respectively. Tesla capturing more than 20% of the market in the next decade? Unlikely. There’s room for multiple players.

# Tesla’s cost advantage: changing gears

Tesla’s early cost advantage was clear. It outperformed luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes. However, as Tesla scales to compete with global giants like Toyota, that advantage is shifting.

Tesla’s cost advantage has been diminishing over time. But it’s too simplistic to say the company has lost its edge. Tesla's innovative production methods and vertical integration still give it a leg up, especially in battery tech and software.

**The bottom line?** While Tesla may no longer dominate on cost alone, its efficiency in key areas keeps it competitive.

# Network effects: a hidden advantage

Tesla’s network effects are one of its most powerful, yet often overlooked, advantages. Simply put, the more Teslas on the road, the more data the company collects. This data, particularly real-world driving data, is crucial for one of Tesla's biggest ambitions: developing fully autonomous driving technology.

Here’s why this matters: self-driving cars rely heavily on vast amounts of data to ""learn"" how to navigate the real world. The more diverse and extensive the data set, the faster and more accurately the system can improve. Tesla, thanks to its large and growing fleet of vehicles, is uniquely positioned to gather this data at an unprecedented scale.

Each Tesla on the road is essentially a sensor, feeding back critical driving information to the company's central database. This includes everything from lane changes and braking patterns to how the car responds to different weather conditions. The result? A constantly evolving, self-learning system that improves with every mile driven.

This creates a powerful feedback loop:

**More Teslas sold → more data collected → better self-driving capabilities → more buyers attracted → even more data collected.**

It’s this self-reinforcing cycle that gives Tesla a significant edge in the race for autonomous vehicles. Competing automakers, no matter how innovative, face a fundamental challenge: they simply don’t have access to the same volume and variety of real-world driving data that Tesla does.

# Building a dynamic moat

Old-fashioned moats alone won’t cut it in today’s fast-paced market. Innovation is key.

Tesla’s story proves this. Yes, the company has traditional advantages like its brand and infrastructure, but what really sets it apart is its commitment to constant innovation.

Playful-Sort9109,A new approach of valuation to define the current value of company's tangible assets,1727035283,1fn264f,0,2,"Hi, I am at college and I am starting to study valuation. I am modelling a supermarket company in Brazil, and I have an idea. I want to know how much of the current price of the stock is attachted to the current value of the company's assets, without adding any growth expectations or assumptions. My ideia is to forecast the present value of Company's tangible assets (in this case, the supermarket stores) + the present value of the cash flows of these current tangible assets, getting to something like this: Current Assets Tangible Value = Invested capital in these current assets + NPV of current assets. In this analysis, I wouldn't consider any new store oppenings or any efficience gains in profitability, as much as any NPV generated by future acquired assets. Therefore, I would get to a price of what the company already have, and I suppose that this price is going to be the same for anyone in the market. So, If I take the total price of company's share and subtract the value for their current and tangible assets and its NPV, i would get the amount of the current share that the market is valuing for the future (something like a Growth rate expectancy). If the current price is very close to the current assets value, I can consider that the future growth of the company is under precified. Does this make sense? And if so, can I just forecast the company without any stores oppenings and any efficience gains to get to this current assets value?

Tenkinreddit,Why MICROSTRATEGY is a bad stock to buy,1727035474,1fn28to,0,1,"Microstrategy is highly levered themselves to buy a ponzi scheme.  
  
I will briefly lay out the reasons BITCOIN/Crypto is a failed experiment, and has become a full fledged ponzi scheme.

Economics of Bitcoin are flawed. In a world where there are growing populations and growing consumption, a fixed supply money will not work.

In a bitcoin standard, you win by being born earlier, and lose by being born later. In a world where there is FINITE money and INFINITE growth of products, you run into a problem where the money becomes more scarce and valuable as time goes on. Simply being born in the future will lead to you slaving under those born before you for their scarce money. This problem only gets worse as time goes on.

With Fiat currency, this issue is solved through debasement, which most argue is bad, but gives a fair start to each human born in the future.

Investment and capitalism would fail in a bitcoin standard. There would be no reason to invest in new business as the most appropriate way to become rich would be hoard your Bitcoin.

FIAT fixes this, with the debasement of the currency you are encouraged to invest in the economy to earn a return greater than the debasement.

You would rarely want to spend your bitcoin because it would naturally buy you more in the future, therefore this would stall economic growth in favor of hoarding an unproductive ""asset""

Fiat fixes this, by debasing the currency at moderate levels you encourage spending, as in the future things will cost more. This helps tremendously with the velocity of money and a functioning economy

The use cases for bitcoin have become eroded over the years. Most importantly, where it was once an unconfiscateable means of exchange that could be used by anyone, it has now become regulated by targeting the On and Off ramps (exchanges). This effectively makes bitcoin or any crypto a permissioned money no different than banks and FIAT. Sure you can send a transaction to someone, but what good is that if it becomes blacklisted and cannot be used?

This was the primary use case and promise for bitcoin, aside from speculation that it would become world currency and be worth more due to its fixed supply.

For the speculators!! - Each cycle has had significant diminishing returns, while having only slightly diminished losses in bear markets. This has led to a dilemma that there may not ever be a new all time high for bitcoin ever again, and it had barely reached one this cycle, it didnt even reach one this cycle if you consider inflation.

This became extremely notable in the last cycle where bitcoin bear market actually broke below the peak of the prior bull market for the first time ever. This is because of what i mentioned above, diminished returns but not so much diminished losses. If there is another cycle, which I doubt there will be due to people recognizing this dynamic, then we should from this point forward see lower highs and lower lows until ZERO.

Red flags include the rampant popularity of crypto as an investment, when the crowd agrees so strongly on something it is clearly late stage, and in some cases just wrong. The saying of ""were so early"" is just not true, and feels like a line passed down from the crypto overlords to be repeated by the blind sheep being led to the slaughter.

Youtube has speculators with big arrows pointing to 1 million to fulfill everyone's fantasies of getting rich quick.

It has become so normalized to say things such as ""it is irresponsible to not have any crypto exposure""

Majority of people in crypto are new to investing and have formed a cult like behavior around the ponzi scheme.

Wall street became involved recently and it is being touted as a way to legitimize the crypto space. Nothing could be further from the truth. This does not legitimize anything. Wall street simply sees people willing to give them free money so they take the opportunity to financialize a product even if it is absolutely no good trash.

LighttBrite,An Informative Post on Econ 101 ,1727220214,1foqfic,0,1,"I recently made a post about KO and Gold and the comments made me realize just how misinformed a lot of this sub (or at least those that commented) are.

There seems to be a worryingly amount of misunderstanding on how rate cuts and inflation works here AND what value investing is. I think a lot of people here just think ""value investing"" is just buying a good stock on a big dip and probably learned from some youtube guru or read a few headlines on geopolitical tensions being the main cause of gold prices. (Someone actually bold faced told me gold is NOT an inflation hedge by any means)

***GOLD/INFLATION:***

When you cut rates, you are ALLOWING people/companies to borrow FOR CHEAPER. This allows BIGGER borrowing for less money. This injects more money into the economy  that can be invested into growth and expansion. This INHERENTLY has inflationary risks. When more money is injected, demand for goods and services can increase, if supply cannot keep up with demand this can cause prices to increase. Gold has been ripping due to multiple things, this includes geopolitical tensions, but more recently it has also been DUE TO RATE CUTS and UNCERTAINTY. As GOLD is an inflation hedge against a FALLING DOLLAR.

Gold is an INFLATION hedge (as opposed to the claim a commenter that blocked me when he found out he was incorrect) AND risk hedge. Rate cuts contribute to this risk due to the possible diminishing purchasing power of fiat currencies..i.e the U.S. Dollar.

This is why it took us so long to cut rates. Inflation had to come to a more stable level before UNLEASHING further **potential** catalyst to inflation. Add this to the fact we have further rate cuts planned and the risk increases. This is economics 101.

***VALUE STOCKS/INVESTING:***

Next, value investing is not just ""buying the dip"". Value stocks are not just stocks on a low. Even stocks that are rising or have hit ATH's recently are still VALUE stocks due to various factors. They usually have several things going for them that make them value. This includes:

- Strong dividends. This makes the stock a VALUE hold stock that you hope to hold for a long time. Hopefully with a strong company with stability and market dominance.

- Stable business model: As opposed to HIGH GROWTH stocks such as NVDA which has seen massive moves due to hype in the AI sector. Though the gains and business is SOLID, it's recent insane valuations are due to massive hype which has uncertainty and could reverse on any number of downfalls.

- Reasonable Valuation: Even if a P/E ratio seems high, that doesn't mean it is ""overpriced"" automatically. Markets have changed and valuations for many sectors have become bloated. You have to consider much more than just that on a companies financials.

KingYao,Turbulence at INTEL - Is the stock a Buy or Sell?,1727231279,1fou248,0,5,"Intel has had a mixed few months. The stock jumped 11%, thanks to the buzz around its foundry spin-off and $3 billion in government funding. However, delays to a $30 billion factory investment in Germany and losing the PlayStation 6 chip contract to AMD have set back its foundry goals. Qualcomm's attempted takeover highlights Intel’s financial difficulties, though it raises antitrust concerns. These events show Intel’s struggle between short-term challenges and long-term restructuring. Now, let's dig deeper into Intel’s performance, stock analysis, and future outlook to decide if it's a buy, hold, or sell.

# 1. Fundamental Analysis (Based on latest Earnings Call and 10-Q)

# Revenue and Profitability

* **Revenue**: Intel reported $12.8 billion in revenue for Q2 2024, relatively flat compared to Q2 2023​. However, Intel is experiencing challenges in some of its core segments like Data Center and AI (DCAI), with revenues declining 3% YoY due to lower demand​.
* **Gross Margins**: The gross margin was significantly impacted, declining to **38.7%**, primarily due to the cost of ramping up AI products and a shift to high-cost wafers​. Margins may remain under pressure in the near term, especially as Intel continues investing in new technologies like AI and 18A nodes.

# Strategic Positioning

* Intel is focused on AI and next-gen chip manufacturing, including the **Panther Lake** CPUs and **Clearwater Forest** server chips​. While this positions Intel well for future growth, these efforts will take time to generate positive cash flow and margin improvement.
* Cost-cutting measures, including a planned **15% headcount reduction**, are part of Intel's restructuring strategy aimed at improving financial efficiency​. The company expects to see benefits from these actions starting in 2025.

# Risks

* Intel has suspended dividends starting in Q4 2024, prioritizing liquidity and investments in growth strategies like AI​. This could deter income-focused investors.
* Challenges from competitors like AMD and TSMC in the CPU and manufacturing spaces continue to weigh heavily on Intel’s market share and profit margins. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and export restrictions also pose significant risks to Intel's business in China​.

# 2. Technical Analysis (Based on Stock Price Data)

* **Recent Price Movements**: Intel’s stock price has been in a volatile state, with recent declines from around $35 in September 2023 to around $21.84 by September 20, 2024.
* **Moving Averages**:
   * **50-Day Moving Average**: The stock has been trading below its 50-day moving average, which suggests a bearish trend.
   * **200-Day Moving Average**: Intel is significantly below its 200-day moving average, reinforcing the long-term bearish sentiment.
* **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: A technical indicator like RSI could provide insights into whether the stock is oversold or overbought. An RSI below 30 would indicate oversold conditions, while an RSI above 70 would signal overbought conditions. The most recent RSI value for Intel, as of September 20, 2024, is approximately **48.79**. This indicates that the stock is neither in overbought nor oversold territory, as RSI values below 30 typically indicate oversold conditions, while values above 70 suggest overbought conditions.Based on this, Intel's stock is in a neutral zone and could move either direction depending on upcoming market factors.
* **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: As of September 20, 2024, Intel's **MACD** is **-0.50**, and the **Signal Line** is **-1.03**.Since the MACD line is above the Signal Line but both values are negative, this could indicate a potential upward momentum, although the stock is still in negative territory. A crossover of the MACD above the Signal Line is often seen as a bullish signal, but given the negative values, it suggests that the stock is recovering from a downtrend rather than entering a strong bullish phase.

3. I contribute $500 a month to my Roth IRA account and buy ETFs only. Any dividends received from the Robinhood and WeBull accounts will go to the Roth IRA to help achieve the annual contribution limit.
4. My company contributes a percentage of my earnings during their fiscal year. I calculated their annual contribution to average a minimum of $580 a month to my Pre-Tax 401(k). Their match is tied to my earnings during their fiscal year so I expect my company's monthly contribution to increase by a few dollars every year.

I've hopefully done most of the legwork. I am shopping for a savings product to stash a down payment. Savings window is probably a few years. I am currently in the Fidelity (brokerage), BOA (checking/Merrill Lynch brokerage), and American Express (card) ecosystems, and would prefer to stay there for my sanity, but y'know. 

Leading candidates are:

* FDLXX (doesn't accrue state/local tax?), currently at 4.94% w/ a .42% ER   

* BOA’s preferred deposit currently at 4.92%  


Seems like BOA PD’s is better for my situation:   
•	Looking at the cons: $100k entry is fine for me, 5 days or however much to withdraw is fine, clunkiness is a bummer but comparable to having to transfer from Fidelity to BOA anyway. I'd have to pay fed and state income taxes on the yield, vs. FDLXX paying fed gains and fed income taxes, and gains are both a lower rate and less likely to happen, which is a bummer. 9.3% CA tax on income means BOA’s rate is more like 4.46%.  
•	Pros: But BOA PD is easier to access in BOA ecosystem, counts toward preferred rewards, and avoids FDLXX's .42% MER which makes its yield more like 4.5% - whatever minimal gains. Do MMFs even make gains? Plus HYSA’s historically bottom out around 1% and often reach the 2s, while MMFs were \~0 in 2015, 16, 20, 21. Obviously you can move the money, but this is set and forget value.

· Read up on what the stock market is in general and how it works  
You should have at least a basic overview of what a stock exchange is, what stock indices are, who a broker is and things like that. You should get some basic information about the process you are potentially going to participate in.  
You should have at least a basic overview of what a stock exchange is, what stock indices are, who a broker is and things like that.  
· Decide how much money you are ready to allocate to investing or trading  
It should be an amount that it's okay for you to lose or invest in your education, i.e. it's not your entire salary or your last savings.  
· Choose an instrument for trading  
You can trade stocks, bonds, futures, options, currency pairs, cryptocurrency – there are many instruments and there is no perfect one, you can make money on each one, the only question is your goals and resources.  
Ask yourself a few questions:  
a) How many hours a day I can spend on studying and trading? If it is 1-2 hours, it is better to choose something simpler. For example, options will definitely not suit you, because they are complicated and require more involvement.  
b) How many percent per year do I want to earn?  
For instance, it’s possible to earn on average about 10-15% on stocks and 50-100% on options.  
c) What level of risk is acceptable for me?  
d) How often I’m ready to review my portfolio and open new trades?  
e) I want to trade or invest?  
And based on your answers and the information you have read, choose an instrument and study it in detail.  
· Choose a trading platform, exchange or broker  
Read about those that suits your instrument, work with the citizens of your country, what are their conditions for opening a trading account (minimum deposit, the size of commissions, etc.).  
· Choose your first trading strategy  
You should always trade not randomly, but according to a plan. This is done so that you could always analyse your mistakes, otherwise it will all be wasted. It is definitely not necessary to invent it yourself, just try the most well-known ones.  
It is better to try it on a demo account, so that you could learn how to work with the platform, and not lose money on some minor things.  
After a few days or weeks of trading on a demo account, try to trade small amounts on a real account, but always set stop-losses, so as not to lose your entire deposit.  
It is absolutely necessary to trade on a real account. You should not spend a year only on a demo account. This is because psychology plays a very important role in trading, which often starts to fail on real money in the form of excessive greed or overconfidence.

Squawk Box: Good show and often has the best guests. Andrew Ross Sorkin and Joe Kernen are both solid interviewers but polar opposites. Andrew is a bit more liberal while Joe is a bit more conservative, they mix well together and Becky provides a good buffer between the two

Squawk on the Street/Money Movers: Good show but it is basically Cramers show. Carl doesn’t do much other than read a headline and let Jim rant. Faber is mostly a M&A guy and doesn’t provide much when acquisitions are slow (like now). Faber is a bachelor who when asked what his favorite part about being on CNBC said is that he gets to go to Saks and pick out suits and CNBC pays for it all. After the first hour, Sara Eisen replaces Jim. And stays on until Wapner and Halftime. Sara is very meh, not great but not awful. While Jim is very focused on individual stocks, Sara is more macro and provides some decent color. You’ll see a lot of good interviews during these times but it’s mostly just CEO’s talking up their companies or activists/short sellers just advertising their positions so be weary.


Jim Cramer: Ok Cramer gets his own section for obvious reasons. A lot of people give Cramer a hard time but I like the guy and think he truly means well and wants to help people. The thing is, is that when you spend years talking about stocks all day, you’re going to be wrong sometimes and he has been wrong and people seem to amplify them and forget about his winners. Nevertheless, the guy is clearly smart (Harvard, Goldman, Hedge Fund) and super well connected and gets great CEOs and guests on Squawk (and Mad Money) despite often asking really tough and direct questions. He is also funny and is able to provide you a good Birds Eye view of companies that are trending that you would otherwise not care about. People say he only talks about stocks he owns and that is true but on purpose as that is what his whole hedge fund strategy was built on before he went on TV. The guy would just talk up stocks he owned to analysts in the 90s and those analysts would talk about the stock, causing people to flock in and the price to rise. Overall, I think Cramer gets a bad rap given what he provides, that’s not to say he is perfect or to take anything he says to your brokerage account but he definitely does not deserve an entire inverse etf

Halftime Report: I usually turn off the sound here as this segment can get annoying. Wapner is alright and can often challenge the guests but it’s hard to tell if I like him as the guests are just abysmal. Most of the guests just like to hear themselves talk. Josh Brown thinks he is Warren Buffet and Scott will never challenge him. Joe T has an etf. If you didn’t know, dont worry, he will mention it multiple times. Stephanie Link just never stops talking. Some of the other guests are good but they can never get a word in because those three love to talk and Scott never interrupts them. Overall, the segment is very foggy as many of the guests are trying to sell themselves/the funds or companies they work for so it can be hard to take anything away from what they say without a large grain of salt that they have other motives for advertising their positions

Power Lunch: I really like this segment as both Kelly and Tyler are laidback and not too serious. No good guests but you often see a lot of interesting stories that aren’t as widely covered. Not much to this part but a good listen as the trading day winds down

Closing Bell: Another solid segment as Scott is good here and the guests are often solid. Nothing too exciting but a good end of the day wrap up.

I usually turn it off after closing bell so can’t provide much color after that but thought I would share my two sense on CNBC market coverage throughout the trading day",investing,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awhjkz/cnbc_market_coverage_overview/

mrknoot,What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario?,1708537481,1awi9lb,0,2,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys.

From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business.

From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm.

If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in *a lot* more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel.

Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes.

[I'm reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/165c0mq/they_would_not_listen_to_us_inside_arizonas/) that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended.

But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive.

Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's *a lot* I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",investing,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awi9lb/whats_the_role_and_future_of_intel_in_taiwans/

I’m 17, turning 18 in September. I’m headed to college in about 3 weeks. I’ve been working since 15 and have $9,000 in my checking account (should be closer to 10k before I go to college), a 2019 Nissan Sentra w/ 64k miles that I plan on selling for ~$8,000, and my mom owes me like $7,000. 

My tuition is $6,000/year but my parents said they would cover it all. This leaves me with over $20,000 after I liquidate everything. I don’t really have any immediate use for the money since I’ll be in college. I might need to access a few hundred here and there, but that’s all. I tried investing, but since I wasn’t 18, I wasn’t able to invest much—only a few hundred on CashApp stocks. At my peak, I had around $330 invested in a bunch of stocks. Cashapp ended up limiting how much I could invest and now I only have like $50 in VOO. 

What would be your advice for me? What should I invest in? Should I open an IRA account? Thank you :) ",investing,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ei9s48/advice_for_17_year_old_with_20000/

I already have just over $60,000 invested in a taxable account with $30,000 in an equivalent to a 401k. The $60,000 is in a taxable account and I won't be able to open an IRA for the next 6months since I'm not working. 

I'll be collecting just over $4k soon monthly for compensation for injuries and it'll continue to be paid for the remainder of my life. The money in the taxable account is mostly in individual stocks. I plan to invest $3k of the 4 monthly into my account. My question is, what would be the best route in order to be set up in 15 years for retirement? I plan to stop investing that $3k and use that to live off as well.

I want to invest this money safely with lower risk for the most part. I've currently been thinking: 35% VOO, 25% VGT, 15%SCHD and 15% DGRO. Goal is to use the dividends as a supplemental income.

Standish37,Pay off Mortgage or Invest?,1722709547,1ejabfd,0,2,"Good afternoon!  I wanted everyone’s input on becoming debt free. My wife and I can pay off our home soon, but I’m slowly learning that it’s not the best move. I was a big follower of Dave Ramsey and becoming debt free, but perhaps that advice is no longer relevant. 

Below are the details on our situation.  We live in California, if that makes any difference. We both max out retirements already, and don’t have any other debts. 

Mortgage - $120k remaining, 15/yr @ 2.375% (~ $2600/ month). 

Savings - $75k, Barclays, 4.35%

I’ve been putting $2k a month into the savings, and $2k extra into the mortgage.  

Bad move?  Is it time to open up an investment account with Fidelity or Charles Schwab, and start investing in Index Funds?  

I always dreamed of having no debt for many personal reasons, but I don’t want to put my family in a worse financial position for my own selfish needs.

Wtf & what to do?,1707444852,1amd2qr,0,1,"Ugh, I am irate at my employer right now. I have been working for a non-profit for a couple years, and just recently found out on my own through a fluke in my personal retirement account portal that my employer has totally effed up and put the ENTIRETY of my 403(b) funds as pre-tax deferrals, as opposed to Roth, which is what I elected since the beginning/what shows up on my personal portal. It was only after speaking with an account representative that I found out my employer 1) had it erroneously down on their payroll; and 2) as well as their administrative portal of the retirement account.

I let my employer know about this, and received an email saying that I can either:

1) keep the account with a) the current pre-tax amount, and b) moving fwd, also have Roth contributions

2) convert to a Roth entirely, but I have to talk to my ""accountant"" (uh, I don't have one) about determining the tax amounts due for the last couple years due to THEIR incompetence.

And no effing apology of course. Just ""this was a clerical error."" Wtf?! I am so pissed. I have to just deal with their incompetence and take on this significantly extra work, and if I elect to do #1, I know I have lost out on $$$ due to their incompetence. And if I do #2, it's going to be hours of more work, and a huge chunk of cash I didn't expect to spend.

On the paycheck, it does have the gross amount of the deferral I elected to have taken out, and I do acknowledge that I should have given more thought to that number reflecting post-tax/Roth.

Am I just screwed here? Is there another option I can pursue to help them be more accountable rather than me just spending either more hours effing figuring this out, or taking the monetary loss?

I have a high risk tolerance, but due to its performance, at this point SOXL makes up around 25% of my portfolio. That combined with my crypto holdings is making me consider rebalancing.

SOXL - $70,600
QQQ  - $61,600

IWY   - $57,000
XLE   - $6,200
Ethereum - $36,500

It’s called stock lending and it allows you to earn extra money for the shares of stocks sitting in your account.

MrAccord,Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR) - Cyclical Play,1726248879,1fg0jpt,0,3,"So I just looked at IVR.  It's an mREIT and gets this status through managing a portfolio of mortgage-related investments.  It has no operation related to originating or servicing mortgages/loans itself.

Portfolio is primarily Agency MBS issues, financed with repurchase agreements, and with hedges to mitigate risks related to credit and interest rate fluctuations.  Repurchase agreements mean that biggest risk is margin calls if their assets decline heavily in value, as happened during the COVID crash.

IVR currently yields around 18%, and this comes from about half of distributable earnings.  When interest rate cuts occur, this will lower the interest expense from their repurchase agreements, while their higher-yield portfolio of MBS issues will keep their yield, boosting earnings.  There's potential for dividend growth and book value appreciation.

That said, just because it's a REIT doesn't mean this is an income/dividend play.  It has to be treated as a cyclical because of the margin call risk and the capital loss that can occur when the pendulum swings the other way.  This is not a Munger-style buy-and-hold forever and deserves an exit plan.",ValueInvesting,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fg0jpt/invesco_mortgage_capital_ivr_cyclical_play/

Traditional-Jump6145,Brookfield: A Growth Stock Priced at Half its Assets,1726607335,1fjay0y,0,112,"Anyone watching Brookfield, seems like a good one to start watching. They just reported its earnings, and the numbers look strong, has growth potential from the value investing perspective.



Starting with distributable earnings, Brookfield achieved an all-time high of $2.75 per share - trailing 12 months. last quarter, they reported $1.1 billion in distributable earnings, an 11% increase per share compared to the previous year. 



Their wealth solutions segment, largely driven by their insurance business, saw a staggering 80% growth year-over-year, and made about $300 million in earnings for the quarter.



Brookfield's asset management business, estimated to be valued at $89.4 billion, is a powerhouse contributing to this growth. Their CEO has stated their goal of doubling assets under management to $2 trillion in the next four years, which on the same margins would double their earnings. 



They have ambitious acquisition plans including a very large renewable energy company—further cementing Brookfield’s position as a leader in the renewable energy space.



In terms of valuation, Brookfield’s stock currently trades at approximately 15.5 times its cash flow, and they're projecting annual growth rates of 20-25% over the next five years. 



So ya, I think it's undervalued. Especially given the expected exponential growth driven, mainly, by the surge in demand for energy and data center construction needed for the AI revolution. They recently signed a deal with Microsoft to build out the energy infrastructure they will need for AI compute.



Am I missing something here? I will say 20% increase of earnings annually seems very ambitious for a company this size.

alphaomegar2,"Report on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO)",1726618353,1fjfdc4,0,5,"**Report on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO)**

**Company Overview**  
Take-Two Interactive is one of the leading global developers and publishers of video games, known for popular franchises such as *Grand Theft Auto* and *NBA 2K*. Its business is divided into the creation of interactive content for consoles, PC, and mobile devices. The company operates through key subsidiaries like Rockstar Games, 2K, Zynga, and Private Division. It has a strong presence in digital distribution, which accounts for over 96% of its revenues​​.

**Recent Financial Performance**  
In the second fiscal quarter of 2024, Take-Two reported revenues of $1,338.2 million, representing a 4.2% increase compared to the previous year. However, the company registered a net loss of $262 million, an increase from the $206 million loss reported the previous year. This was largely due to rising marketing and development costs, partly driven by the launch of new titles, including Zynga's *Match Factory!*​.

**Revenue and Margin Analysis**  
Recurring consumer spending (virtual content and microtransactions) represents 82% of total revenue, highlighting the importance of in-game transactions as a key driver. By platform, mobile devices generate 54% of revenues, with consoles and PCs capturing 38% and 8%, respectively.  
In terms of margins, the gross margin improved to 57.6% in Q2 2024 due to lower royalty costs and reduced amortization of intangible assets. However, the operating margin remains negative at -13.7%, reflecting continued pressure on profitability from high operating and development costs.

**Growth Prospects**  
The company has a strong pipeline of future releases, including high-profile titles like *Grand Theft Auto VI*, expected in 2025, which is projected to significantly boost revenues. Additionally, Zynga’s integration strengthens its position in the lucrative mobile gaming market. Despite current losses, Take-Two is expected to achieve annual revenue growth between 5% and 7% over the next few years​​.

**Risks and Challenges**  
Key risks include high industry competition, fluctuations in consumer demand, and potential regulatory changes affecting game monetization. Moreover, high player acquisition costs and the development of AAA titles may further pressure future margins​​.

**Stock Valuation**  
The current stock price of $152.71 appears slightly overvalued, with an estimated intrinsic value close to $145 based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Despite current losses, the company has a solid product base and a strategic cost-reduction plan that could improve long-term profitability​.

**Recommendation**  
Given the current context, the recommendation is to **wait before investing**. While future growth appears promising, short-term risks like continued losses and stock overvaluation suggest that a price correction could offer a better entry opportunity​.

**Conclusion**  
Take-Two Interactive boasts a robust portfolio and a strong position in the gaming market, but it faces short-term operational and profitability challenges. In the long term, the release of *Grand Theft Auto VI* and its focus on recurring digital content could provide sustained growth​.

I can’t put away to max both contribution limits of each plan.

_Naix_,Greed: Wealth's Ruthless Enemy,1708342156,1aul5f4,0,1,"I [33M] was there when FTX collapsed, sending the entire Crypto market plummeting. Prior to this event, I diligently followed numerous Twitter accounts in the Crypto space and was thoroughly following reputable Crypto YouTubers, intending to invest in crypto before the whole FTX incident unfolded. Little did I know that I was witnessing a significant dip and should have seized the opportunity to buy at that time.

Regrettably, I waited, hoping for an even greater drop so I could purchase during the ""real"" dip. Unfortunately, my hesitation was fueled by greed, leading to a missed opportunity. Reflecting on it now, I find it difficult to forgive myself for not capitalizing on the Crypto market during that downturn. I could have at least bought some and sold them today, at a profit.

Dealing with the daily realization that, as a first-time investor, I missed a massive chance is undeniably disheartening.

Moving forward, I'd like to ask what are some investments that could yield returns in the short-to-medium run. While I understand the stock market is often seen as a long-term investment, I'm not looking to invest with a huge amount at this time.

dukerustfield,Lithium extraction in USA,1707757746,1ap50cb,0,8,"people have asked about lithium lately so I thought I’d post. There is a push by Biden admin to develop local capacity, as China currently dominates the biz. A crash in lithium prices has put many projects on hold. Also, regions are demanding more protection of their natural resources. Bribe water is a big source of lithium and evaporation pools had always been common, which can leave layers of toxic chemicals in its wake. New methods, like this article about Utah’s Great Salt Lake, pump water out and filter it, leaving the lake largely in tact.

From Wall Street journal:

https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/great-salt-lake-lithium-startup-lilac-d84c9f76?mod=djem10point

> This summer, a California startup plans to start construction on a project to suck up water from the Great Salt Lake to extract one of its many valuable minerals: lithium

> The effort is one of dozens of projects across the U.S. racing to build up a domestic supply of lithium and other battery minerals, with adoption of electric vehicles expected to boom as part of the country’s transition to cleaner energy. The Biden administration is dedicating billions of dollars to strengthening the U.S. battery supply chain and reducing reliance on China, which dominates the global production of battery minerals.

> The challenge: finding ways to efficiently extract the mineral from rocks and water while minimizing environmental damage.

> “Lithium resources in the U.S. are very large in scale, but the chemistry is very challenging,” said Lilac founder and Chief Executive Dave Snydacker. 

> Briny water is among the most promising resources for lithium in the U.S. Exxon Mobil is drilling for lithium-laden brines deep underground in Arkansas’s Smackover region. Other companies are working to extract lithium from brines in California’s Salton Sea. 

It’s funny that oil companies are getting in on it. One of the major pitfalls of drilling for oil is you often hit saltwater first. And it was hard to dispose of it because it destroys agriculture and there was a lot of it. Like they’re leasing these drilling spots often from ranchers or agricultural areas. if they had a gusher of saltwater without properly containing it, that land would be unable to support much in the way of vegetation because it was contaminated with salt. So what had always been an annoying aspect of oil and gas drilling is trying to be leveraged into a lithium mine. And oil companies got a century or so experience of dealing with it.

> crash in prices for lithium and other battery minerals in 2023 prompted mining companies to slow expansions of projects and put new ones on hold.

We all know that algos/computers and not humans, make the majority of trades. But I haven’t really heard that index investors—which this forum pushes hard—has collapsed value category of stocks. 

Everyone is pushing VTI/SPY. (Which are ETFs I own/trust/like). And you wonder how many ppl on this forum own those underlying stocks in the exact same weight as each other. Which is a weird concept when you think about it. 

From MarketWatch interview:

> Value is just not a consideration for most investment money that’s out there. There’s all the machine money and algorithmic money which doesn’t have an opinion about value it has an opinion about price: ‘What is the price going to be in 15 minutes and I want to be ahead of that,'” he explained.

> As money moves from active management to passive, value managers are forced to deal with redemptions. They then sell their holdings, which causes value stocks to fall further, triggering more redemptions. “All of a sudden the people who are performing are the people who own the overvalued things that are getting the flows from the indexes. You take the money out of value and put it in the index, they’re selling cheap stuff and they’re buying whatever the highest multiple, most overvalued things are in disproportionate weight,”

> now means that you no longer have to pay 10 times earnings to profit An investor can now find the same scenario at four or five times earnings. And if an investor pays four to five times earnings and the balance sheet isn’t levered, the company should be able to return cash and buy back 10% to 20% of its stock. That means in four or five years, it’s either going to run out of stock or the price is going to go up, he said.

Mission-Ad-1656,gaza + caterpillar = bullish! post got taken down from stocks!,1707687344,1aoj84y,0,1,"Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT)  
  
The U.S.-based multinational, Caterpillar, is a long-standing supplier of the Israeli military and provides it with a variety of heavy engineering machinery for military use, including the D9 bulldozer.  
  
Caterpillar machinery has been widely used for house demolition, settlement construction, and the construction of the Separation Wall in the occupied West Bank. Armored D9 bulldozers are used by the Israeli military to accompany military forces during invasions and military arrests in the occupied West Bank.  
  
The D9 bulldozers have been adapted to the military's needs and some are currently undergoing adaptation to enable autonomous operations without the need for a driver.  
  
Caterpillar machinery and the D9 armored bulldozers have been extensively used in previous Israeli attacks on Gaza in 2021, 2014, 2008, and 2009, for large-scale house demolitions, land-clearing missions, and the construction of the wall surrounding the besieged Gaza.  
  
The Caterpillar D9 is also used in the Israeli military's so-called “Pressure Cooker” procedure, which is used to pressure a wanted person who fortifies in a house or other structure, to come out. In such cases, the D9 is used to demolish the structure with the person still inside. This procedure has been used against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.  
  
Since October 7, the Combat Engineering Corps has carried out an extensive recruitment of D9 bulldozer drivers to take part in the invasion of Gaza. D9 bulldozers have been documented in the streets of Gaza causing massive destruction to roads, buildings, private property, and infrastructure.  
  
In November 2023, the IMOD initiated an urgent procurement of dozens of D9 heavy bulldozers. Some of these D9 bulldozers are currently undergoing adaptation processes for autonomous or semi-autonomous operations, allowing the bulldozers to operate without the need for a driver  
  
Been long since 270, think we could see 500 with the D9s!

jackandjillonthehill,"Thoughts on Interactive Brokers - IBKR and brokerage stocks more generally (Schwab SCHW, Robinhood HOOD, StoneX SNEX, and Etrade ETFC)",1726632185,1fjk1cu,0,11,"IBKR  
High quality brokerage business, great advertising, great service, very low fee, access to tons of international stocks and reasonable margin for retail investors. Caters to 'sophisticated' retail investors and the lower tier of professional investors who can't afford a prime brokerage at an investment bank. 

Trailing PE 20.8, forward PE of 19.1  
P/Book of 3.6X, with an ROE that has been consistently growing over time, from 6% in 2010 to 22% in the TTM period.   
Net income growth of 13-14% in the last few quarters, but expected to slow to mid single digits in upcoming years.   
Stock has compounded at 17.7% over the past 10 years, well outperforming S&P 500.   
  
A similar business, and maybe even a better value is StoneX (SNEX). It has a similar niche of 'sophisticated retail' or low end professional investors. 

Trailing PE of 11.4, forward PE of 11.4, analysts forecasting 0-3% earnings growth, P/B of 1.6, ROE of 16%.   
Stock has compounded at 21% over past 10 years, well above S&P 500, with less volatility than S&P 500. 



Comparable price and value ratios for other brokerage stocks are:  
  
Charles Schwab - SCHW - Trailing PE of 26, forward PE of 18.7, P/B of 3.5, ROE of 14%, trailing earnings growth of about -30%, (but expected by analysts to bounce back in earnings over the next couple of years...)  
  
Robin Hood - HOOD - Trailing PE of 70.7, forward PE of 20.9, P/B of 2.8, ROE of 4%, net income growth expected to be 100% this year, then estimated by analysts 10% thereafter...

We also have some data for E-trade when it was acquired in October 2020 by Morgan Stanley for $58.75 per share, although all stocks were somewhat cheaper at that time during the pandemic.   
Etrade - ETFC - Trailing PE of 15.6X, (no forward PE available), P/B of 1.9, ROE of 12%

  
I think the ranks of the 'sophisticated retail' investors and semi professional investors are likely to grow much more than the broader retail investor audience. COVID introduced a lot of new investors who keep demanding more sophisticated financial tools/instruments. Platforms like Schwab, Robinhood, and Etrade are adding this functionality on top of very basic brokerage services, whereas platforms like interactive brokers or StoneX were built with more advanced brokerage functions in mind. 

Interactive Brokers might be a sufficiently better business to trade at a premium to peers, and I think the earnings growth might compound north of 10% in the next decade like it has historically. Would probably wait for a bit more margin of safety before taking a bite, but seems like it could be juicy.

bawera23,The Forgotten Commodity: Coal’s Quiet Resilience in a Changing World,1726666841,1fjt2vp,0,23,"# Introduction

The coal industry is facing a long-term decline, particularly in developed nations where environmental concerns and the push for renewable energy sources are becoming more prevalent. Despite this, coal remains a crucial energy and industrial resource in many parts of the world. Almost a billion people still live without electricity, and over a billion more lack reliable energy sources. These populations, particularly in developing countries, are expected to continue using coal, especially for thermal energy generation. Additionally, metallurgical (met) coal is essential for producing steel and other metals, which are critical for economic development and technological progress. With the rapid industrial expansion of China and India, demand for met coal is expected to remain strong for years to come. Even in the developed world, the need for new ferric materials will persist, as recycling alone cannot meet the demands of an evolving civilization.

If you want to see the whole theis with the graphs and valuation images go to my substack:

[https://open.substack.com/pub/smallcaptreasures/p/the-forgotten-commodity-coals-quiet?r=1od1d5&utm\_campaign=post&utm\_medium=web](https://open.substack.com/pub/smallcaptreasures/p/the-forgotten-commodity-coals-quiet?r=1od1d5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)

Investors can sometimes achieve exceptional returns even in declining industries. A prime example is the cigarette industry. Despite steady declines in cigarette consumption over recent decades, tobacco stocks have significantly outperformed major indices. This illustrates that well-managed companies in shrinking markets can still deliver substantial value to shareholders, particularly through disciplined capital allocation, such as stock buybacks and dividend payments.

As you can see tobacco stocks have outperformed the overall market for 40 years, this is a perfect example of what could happen with coal due to the low valuations and share buyback programs these companies have.

Some big investors are getting really interested in the coal market. A prime example is Mohnish Pabrai, a renowned value investor, who has made a significant investment in coal, signaling his belief in the potential for outsized returns in the sector. His investment underscores the thesis that, despite the widespread belief that coal is a ""dead"" industry, there are still opportunities for savvy investors to capitalize on mispricing and supply-demand imbalances.

As you can see all of his 4 US holdings are coal mining companies, three of them only produce met coal and one of them (CONSOL) produces both.

Pabrai explained in an interview why he liked coal stocks:

“Recently, the two stocks I found in the US, which I got very excited about, are like that. I never thought I'd find that again, where it's this kind of anomaly where **the guaranteed cash flows are exceeding the market cap** and all of that.”

In this statement he was referring to his positions in Alpha Metallurgical Resources and CONSOL, we will dig deeper in each of these companies in the following weeks.

Recently, Guy Spier, another renowned investor, started a position in two metallurgical coal miners.

# Why the Opportunity Exists

The primary reason this opportunity exists is that most European and American investors, who control the bulk of global capital, have written off coal as a viable investment. This sentiment is further compounded by the rise of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, which has made coal ""uninvestable"" for many large banks and institutional funds. This has created a situation where coal assets are undervalued, despite their continued importance in certain regions of the world, particularly in developing economies. As demand for coal persists or even grows in certain areas, this undervaluation presents a compelling opportunity for contrarian investors.

ReptilPT,"Ubisoft falling and possible ""leaking"" of information",1727345522,1fpsqg5,0,13,"Ubisoft had another hard blow yesterday. They postponed AC Shadows, their biggest selling point for this fiscal year after their other big selling point underperforming sales wise (it was actually not badly receive).

Their stock (which unfortunately I owe some) has been plumming in the last few weeks. In June, after some bump in some ratings, it went up to 22/23 euros. Then fall until 15. Then 11 this last few weeks. Was going slowly back to 13, until yesterdays news. It is around 9 now.

There are two points i want to adress

1. I made a comment/post about this some months ago. Out of nowhere Ubisoft stock started going up (big purchases) and then 2-3 days later they dropped some important news/trailers that hyped the community and value. Now it was similar. One or two weeks ago, a huge number of stocks started to be sold. Which seemed a bit of panic but was weird. And now we get the news of this delay. Maybe it is unrelated. But maybe it is not?
2.  Is the panic a bit too much? I mean currently the company is its lowest since when? Even at 11-13 it seemed super low for a company that has a huge portfolio of IPs. I am not saying they will recover in 2 days. But if they can re-organize themselves a bit, and it seems they are making an effort on it (leaked internal message from yesterday mentioned going day 1 to Steam, etc etc). I do believe there is some value. But again..I believed there was value at 17eur as well. I might be wrong.

I would argue that if I knew they would delay both their mobile games and AC, I would never bought their stock to start with. However, I still feel that the current value is super low. The panic period is not over yet and their earning report will be in one month. But I feel that they can't remain under two digits for long.

OperationTestify,"Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO, USA)",1726276529,1fgarkd,0,4,"I prepared a detailed analysis of Take-Two Interactive, a leading video game developer and publisher known for its successful franchises Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, NBA 2K and many others. The company lost its way in recent years after an overpriced acquisition and is in the process of cleaning house. We will see how that goes. They announced a new AAA title release (GTA VI) for the holiday season next year. Could be a catalyst for the bottom line and the share price. Key multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E) are currently negative.

Management has not prioritized shareholders' interests in my view. The business developed in the right direction (growth, profitability, move to digital distribution and recurring revenue models, etc.), and then they made a bad call. The more you pay for something, the less inclined you are to doubt it. Well, I doubt it. 

I will follow this closely to see if they can improve by mid-2025 ahead of the GTA VI release.

i4value,DKSH Malaysia got a one time boost with its 2019 acquisitions,1726276825,1fgauy7,0,2,"2019 was a crucial year for Bursa Malaysia DKSH. It acquired Auric Pacific that had a strong presence in the food service channel. It also covered chilled and frozen products in both food service and grocery channels. 



The acquisition boosted DKSH revenue growth. Furthermore, returns that were declining for some time seemed to reach the bottom in 2019 and began to improve. But these improvements seem to be tapering off suggesting that the 2019 acquistion was a one-time boost. 



The positive sign is that there is more than 30% margin of safety at the current market price. These suggest that if you are going to invest in DKSH, it should view it as a cigar-butt investment rather than investing in a compounder

RhinoInsight,Why the Next Decade Won't Mirror the Past: Rethinking ETF Investments,1726666876,1fjt3df,0,1,"Most ETF investors make the mistake of believing that the next 10-20 years will unfold similarly to the last 4-6 decades. However, when you consider the following points, it becomes clear that things are set to change:

* The debt situation of nearly all countries, led by the USA
* Geopolitical tensions surrounding a new world order, including economic factors and financial markets
* The heavy concentration of ETFs, such as the S&P 500, which is dominated by tech stocks

Originally, the idea behind ""Passive Investing"" was to **diversify broadly**, **manage risk**, and minimize costs and taxes. Nowadays, however, the first two principles are rarely discussed.

One of the most successful investors, David Einhorn, once said in an [interview](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/markets-are-fundamentally-broken-due-to-passive-investing-says-david-einhorn/ar-BB1hZCjR):

anjuna42,"Confused about rolling over 401k, backdoor Roth and pro-rata rule",1708541145,1awjtwt,0,14,"Hi all, 

I've done some research and searched old posts but haven't found myself grasping the considerations around rolling over my old employer 401k.   


Situation is as follows:

I have a Traditional 401(k) at T. Rowe Price from an old employer, balance is around $75k with $65k being contributions and $10k earnings.

The rest of my retirement accounts are at Vanguard, where I have two 401(k)'s from previous employers, a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. The Traditional and Roth IRAs at Vanguard are used for backdoor Roth each year, as our income is over the limit for directly contributing to Roth IRA.  


My goal is to simplify life by moving the 401(k) to Vanguard. As best I can tell, I'm paying $36/yr in fees to T. Rowe Price at the moment.  


I have read that high income earners should not rollover a 401(k) to a Traditional IRA because of the IRS pro-rata rule impacting backdoor Roth IRA, though I can't say I could explain why that is. However, I do know that I want to continue doing backdoor Roth IRA each year for the next 20 years or so.  


I am also considering taking rolling over the T. Rowe Price Traditional 401(k) to a Roth IRA and taking the income tax hit, sort of like a mega backdoor Roth but taking $75k in pre-tax retirement and making it $75k in Roth retirement money. In this case, would I still run into issues with future backdoor Roth IRA contributions and the IRS pro-rata rule?   


TLDR: If I convert a Traditional 401(k) from an old employer to a Roth IRA, will it compromise my ability to do future backdoor Roth IRA contributions?

Thanks for reading, any advice appreciated.

JohnnyBravo_008,Upcoming 20 year Treasury bond auction. ,1708230923,1atlnjz,0,20,"Curious if anyone is planning on buying the 20 year bonds this upcoming auction. From my understanding, the final rate is based of the competitive bids which is in close relation to any 20 year Tresury index fund (US:20Y) (4.56% currently) of a brokage of your choice. ""The Snap"" price.

Not saying this is the always the case, you could have a ""Tail"" weaker demand and get a better rate. Or you cold get a ""Stop Through"" higher demand and get a less desirable rate. 

My questions are;

Do I have an understanding how the auction works?

What is the difference between this upcoming auction dated 2-21-2024 (20 year) vs  3-19-2024 (19 year 11 month) vs 4-17-2024 (19 year 10 month)? Is it just hoping to get a slightly better rate?

The Fed metting in May, might mention Cuts, but these are before that, so again is it just hopes it goes up, and it's worth waiting the month or 2 in hopes of that? 

Also noticed if you use a broker the rate is about 25 basis points off, is that just the broker's cut for making it simple to order? I don't see why anyone wouldn't just buy direct from the Treasury website and get the full rate awarded.

f00dl3,Why did the market think the Fed would cut rates this year?,1708445173,1avl95c,0,22,"I'm wondering if there's a logistical reason to why the market tried to call the Federal Reserve's bluff to rate cuts this year? 

&#x200B;

I'm unsure why the market would just go about and assume that rate cuts ""had to happen"" and price in 7 rate cuts, when the fact is this is an election year. The Federal Reserve claims to have no part in our political system, so I don't understand why they would want to give any perceptions or assumptions of anything going on until after the election in November is finished? 

&#x200B;

To me it seems pretty clear cut that unless something breaks significantly (large bank failures such as JP Morgan or Capital One or Wells Fargo, etc) - that there is no reason to lower interest rates until after the election. Inflation is still a big question. YoY CPI is around 3% but inflation is still 20-25% since 2020. The economy is ""booming"" if you take the jobs reports to be truthful. And in may ways if we find out the jobs numbers are lies, the market could react by having a huge surge which would cause more inflation. 

  
Europe and China are in recession, but that's no reason for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in the U.S. Like Bloomberg said all of last year - we have a case of American Exceptionalism here. 

&#x200B;

I think the stock market at best will be flat all year while people start to realize those rate cuts are not happening. Next year we may have a crash after the election is decided when they cut rates and it creates the ""perception"" that something is broken, even if nothing is ""broken,"" per-se.",investing,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1avl95c/why_did_the_market_think_the_fed_would_cut_rates/

1) when withdrawing how are most people doing it? Do you just put a recurring withdraw on your account allowing you to essentially give yourself a paycheck every 2 weeks or every month? And, to clarify, your residual money in the account(s) is still earning interest, correct? So potentially growing at a faster rate assuming you have enough in there and you’re living a modest enough lifestyle in retirement (earnings outweigh your withdraw amount).

2) with all the baby boomers retiring currently, are there any expected “side-effects” as they continue pulling their money from the market to sustain their retired lifestyles? For instance I know VOO is a very popular fund to invest in, is there some expectation that their withdraws will cause a loss in those funds?

NYCandrun,Hedging long term treasuries  loosing their crisis alpha at some point in the next 30-50 years. (I have leveraged bond exposure through Wisdom Tree’s “efficient core” products),1722405365,1egfqck,0,2,"I have recently come to believe that the risk of a long end blowout (rising yields) related to the growing deficit is severely understated over a long enough investment time horizon. A deficit issue could very well be of a scale that marks the highwater of US dollar and equity dominance and ushers in a period of significant international outperformance.

In a scenario of an economic crisis that coincides with a bond market consensus that US debt is nearing its upper bounds of interest serviceability, long term treasuries could lose their crisis alpha as they may receive no sponsorship. In other words, the 'fed put' may cease to exist as the deficit cannot be allowed to expand any further lest interest payments becomes unbearable in relation to the federal budget in the absence of significant debt restructuring/default.

I recognize that there are several robust reasons why long duration treasuries could still perform well in an environment of gradually rising interest rates.

OddNefariousness5993,Cryptography as a modern bait of investment scams,1722406151,1egfxxt,0,1,"Scamming means tricking people to get their money. People won't just give their money to others. If you approach a random person and ask them $100K they would say you're crazy. That's why a bait is needed. Something to trick people. Charles Ponzi used postal coupons for that purpose. Bernie Madoff used a split-strike conversion strategy. And today's scammers use cryptography as bait.
 
How does that bait work? Scammers first come up with a cryptographic system that shows numbers on the screen. They then claim that these numbers are money. Because nowadays, money, that is fiat money, is just numbers - either on bank accounts or banknotes. So, because their systems show numbers just like banking systems, scammers claim to have invented money. Finally, they claim that their money is better than fiat money because numbers are cryptographically protected and stored in decentralized databases, while the number holders are anonymous. Banks, on the other hand, store their numbers on paper(on banknotes) or in centralized databases, with the number holders being identified by real names.

Once the bait is set, and the scammers have initially and anonymously 'mined' large numbers with negligible electricity consumption, they start spreading propaganda about the revolutionary money of the future. And so people start investing fiat money or useful items - goods, services, etc. However, what the scammers won't tell, is that their systems don't return useful items to number holders. That's the crux of the scams because banks do return useful items. And that's essentially what the scammers want. They want goods, services, labor, real estate, the ability to pay taxes, etc. Because there's no benefit in watching numbers.

How do banks return useful items to number holders? By issuing numbers as debt. A new bank deposit, i.e. a number on a bank account, is created when a commercial bank issues a loan or a central bank subscribes to a government bond. Of course, when that number is paid out in banknotes, nothing essentially changes. It still represents debt but is written on paper instead of on the screen. Once the numbers are created that way, debtors trade them in the market for labor, goods, services and other useful items. However, since they represent debt towards the banks, debtors need the numbers back.  That is why they are forced to sell useful items to those that hold the numbers.

If debtors don't sell useful items to number holders they will default on their loans. Then, the collaterals will be activated and the banks will sell debtors' property at auctions. Who will have access to these auctions? Well, the holders of bank-issued numbers. Since the banks issued these numbers as debt, they must accept them to liquidate the unpaid debt. Finally, because governments issue bonds denominated in bank-issued numbers, they must accept these numbers as payment for taxes. Otherwise, they cannot pay off their bonds. That is, therefore, how the banks return goods, services, labor, real estate, the ability to pay taxes, and other useful items to number holders.

Cryptosystems don't have such a return mechanism. After people join a cryptosystem by investing useful items or fiat money, and get numbers on the screen, the only way they can return their investments is if new investors enter the system. So, just like in the schemes organized by Charles Ponzi or Bernie Madoff. Regardless if they invested tons of electricity through 'mining', cars, houses, years of labor, millions of dollars, whatever, cryptosystems can't help them at all. Without new investors, they cannot get anything back.

That's why whenever someone creates a cryptocurrency what they actually created is bait. A bait to attract investors and get fiat money or useful items. By holding fiat money the scammer is in a system that ensures the return of useful items. While victims are left in cryptosystems where they depend on new investors.

I am with Equityzen but considering to move to another one.",1707452905,1amform,0,1,"I am investing in pre-IPO companies with a broker Equityzen. When you invest with Equityzen, investments are usually structured as parts of a funds. In other words, Equityzen acquires shares of a pre-IPO company and converts it to a fund and sell it to retail investors. So what you own is a part of a fund that owns shares of a single pre-IPO company. 

As you are a LLP (limited liability partnership), Equityzen has a sole discretion whether to participate in a tender offer (i.e., a process of pre-IPO company buying back their shares). 

My problem is that Equityzen usually opts in tender offers. Although I made a handsome profit of 200% from tender offers over a couple of years, my expectation is not to step out with such early profit, but to hold them longer until IPO (or being sold to a big company) for a greater profit. 

So I am searching for a broker where I can directly own shares. 

\- Which brokers are you investing with?

\- When a company goes for IPO (or sold to a bigger company), your broker updates you the news and advise your next step (e.g., how to sell your shares)?

\- does your broker also updates you major news or deal of the company such as tender offers or others? 

Any advise would be appreciated. Thank you so much in advance for sharing your experience.

It’s currency and costs of living are low so cost from the outside so would be easy to invest. Education levels are again good, political situation is more stable then most in the area. It’s at a geographically good position. And should gain political support since Ethiopia gave it acceptance. It’s granted a poor investment choice short term, but long term holds a lot of potential. Since if it gains political support from other countries who will most likely be western powers due to its support of Taiwan and anti terrorist activities.

Funny_Guitar_4202,Confusion surrounding S&P 500 unrealized and realized gains,1707368724,1alnxeq,0,1,"In a fund such as a Vanguard S&P 500, should you periodically take profits (capital gains) and then reinvest them into the same fund? Or is it better to just leave it alone? If it’s the latter, won’t those funds theoretically be ‘unrealized’ forever? 

For example, if $3,000 was deposited into an S&P 500 mutual fund and a year later it rose to $4,000, would it not be smart to ‘realize’ the $1,000 and then re-invest it into the fund? 

I’ve read to ‘set it and forget it,’ but part of me wonders if this is just leaving money on the table, so to speak, if the gains are never realized.

dubov,This is hard sometimes,1727111175,1fnplqb,0,8,"Had a dilemma recently and really wasn's sure what to do

I'm holding shares in Vienna Insurance Group, an Austrian based insurance company who are one of the largest insurers in Central and Eastern Europe.

As some of you may have heard, CEE was recently hit by some fairly serious flooding.

I deliberated whether I should sell my shares, or at least reduce my position, but I realised I can't really assess it as I don't have enough infomation. I don't know what the extent of their liabilities is, and I couldn't work it out without a detailed list of their clients in the areas. And, I don't know how much of the risk they would have re-insured. 

I also had other thoughts like maybe there will be some positives: it might be possible to increase premiums after this, or maybe more people will buy insurance (there are bound to be some horror stories about the guy who didn't and lost everything). So while there might be a bad quarter coming up, the overall effect might not be bad. But again, I don't think I can properly assess it.

So I'm holding the stocks and I'm going to take the long view. The company is great IMO. Very boring but solid as a rock. But no denying it has been tempting to dump them and hope to rebuy cheaper later, I think I would have a good shot. But that's trading, not investing.

Candid-Persimmon-612,"22nd Century Group: Pioneering Reduced-Harm Tobacco Solutions
",1727378822,1fq4nh3,0,1,"In the evolving landscape of the tobacco industry, **22nd Century Group, Inc. (**$**XXII)** emerges as a trailblazer with its innovative approach to smoking alternatives. The company is making significant strides with its flagship product, **VLN® cigarettes**, which have gained attention as the world’s first and only combustible cigarettes to receive a **Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP)** designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This remarkable achievement positions 22nd Century as a potential leader in a market increasingly focused on reduced harm and safer smoking options.

# VLN® Cigarettes: A Game Changer

**VLN® cigarettes** are uniquely engineered to contain significantly lower levels of nicotine, catering to adult smokers who wish to reduce their nicotine intake or quit smoking entirely. With nicotine content reduced by up to **95%** compared to traditional cigarettes, VLN® serves as a novel alternative that aligns with public health goals aimed at minimizing tobacco-related harm. The MRTP designation is pivotal; it indicates that the FDA recognizes VLN® as a product that may benefit public health by reducing the risk of addiction and promoting a safer smoking experience.

This innovative approach not only distinguishes VLN® cigarettes in the market but also addresses growing concerns about the health risks associated with traditional smoking. By offering a product that allows smokers to enjoy the ritual of smoking while significantly lowering their nicotine consumption, 22nd Century Group is fostering a more responsible way of using tobacco.

# A Mission with Purpose

The company’s mission encapsulates its forward-thinking ethos: **""Our mission is to sell the last cigarette before the 22nd Century.""** This tagline reflects not only the innovative spirit of 22nd Century but also its commitment to transitioning smokers towards reduced-risk products. By emphasizing harm reduction, 22nd Century aligns itself with the global shift towards more responsible tobacco use, resonating well with investors looking for companies that embody sustainability and social responsibility.

This mission is particularly relevant in a world increasingly concerned about health and wellness. With public sentiment shifting towards products that mitigate health risks, 22nd Century Group stands poised to capitalize on this trend, appealing to a demographic eager for safer alternatives.

# Strategic Growth and Future Prospects

In addition to VLN® cigarettes, 22nd Century Group is expanding its portfolio with innovative products and partnerships, solidifying its role as a leader in the reduced-harm tobacco sector. The company's recent agreements to produce filtered cigars and conventional cigarettes underscore its commitment to growth and diversification.

As 22nd Century Group navigates this evolving landscape, its focus on harm reduction and innovative tobacco solutions positions it favorably for long-term success. With a mission that speaks to the future of smoking and a product line that meets the demands of health-conscious consumers, 22nd Century Group is not just responding to market trends; it is actively shaping the future of the tobacco industry.

In conclusion, 22nd Century Group’s pioneering efforts with VLN® cigarettes and its commitment to a sustainable mission signal a transformative approach to tobacco use. As the company continues to innovate and expand, it remains a compelling option for investors and consumers alike, driving forward in a landscape that prioritizes health and safety.",ValueInvesting,0.25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fq4nh3/22nd_century_group_pioneering_reducedharm_tobacco/

0.5 BP cut from the Fed today!  



This is NOT something that is done when the economy is healthy, lol!  Cutting rates is inflationary.  However, there is generally a lag between the causes of inflation and the effects of inflation.  There's going to be a rare window in which rates are low but prices haven't caught up yet, in my opinion.  I think the prices for everything are about to go up when the effects of this inflation that the Fed has just created occur.  This would include stonks, metals (especially precious metals), and definitely property.  It's only a matter of when the prices go up and how low the Fed will keep cutting.  It's pretty clear the Fed has no intention of deflating the property bubble.  



Good luck to all of you new home buyers!  Even if the principal remains staggering, at least the interest rates will be lower.

  
How do you all think these cuts are going to go, and how low do you think the Fed will go?  

I think this Fed behavior will eventually put is in a sort of inflationary hell in the long term, but things might get pretty exciting next year at least.

For context I have about $15000 between ETFs and a HYSA.

Looking at my gains / losses I’m only up 2%.

Couple of questions I have are:

1. How is this calculated? I just recently (last few weeks) I bought all the SCHD I have, and 2 more shares of QQQ. How are the gains / losses calculated even though I’ve already had some QQQ? Does it take into account say I bought QQQ at $400 a year ago (hypothetical) and it went up 10% to today. I bought more today ($440) and it went down 5% in a year ($418). My total gain / loss would be +5%? Is that right? 

2. Is my percentage of gain / loss because a small % of my portfolio is actually invested? I only have about $3700 invested and 10,000 in a HYSA. So portfolio wise I’m not up a bunch but individual ETFs I’m up around 20%? (QQQ is around +14% & SCHD is +6%)

Colt1945,J.P. Morgan Innovators Strategy,1708549407,1awnatc,0,2,"I recently met with an advisor after opening a Chase account. I have always managed my own funds/IRA/401k and have done well with it for my age, (I'm 32). The advisor is attempting to persuade me into transferring the funds over to an actively managed model with a 1.3% fee. (much higher than my .05% at vanguard or my TSP).

When comparing my S&P 500 performance just for last year at 9.4%, compared to this ""Innovators strategy"" which has an AI growth focus (I think???), it seems like chump returns when they did 34.7% last year. 

I'm trying to gather different perspectives on if and why I should move some funds into this realm to see those more aggressive returns, I'm concerned I'm pinching pennies in regards to expense ratios and losing out on real dollars over the long term. I have the appetite for aggressive growth and full stocks, I just fear moving 100+k  (100k is the minimum) of IRA money into an actively managed fund without thoroughly considering all pros/cons of it.

When breaking down the math, I assume I have technically missed out on some growth, though I'm not sure how to factor into the advisor fees into the overall return.

Vanguard Account Return 10 years - 10.1%

JP Morgan Active Strategy- 15.7%

Given its proximity to a healthcare facility, the location seems prime for something that could serve hospital visitors or staff.

The thought process here is to potentially build apartments which could be really convenient for hospital employees or those with loved ones in long-term care.  
The question I'm grappling with is whether the rezoning effort, which I know can be quite a process, would be worth the potential gains.

VereorVox,Portfolio question on stock holdings,1722522270,1ehhzcw,0,1,"I see it often recommended not to exceed 5% per stock holding. Other times I see this number bumped up to 7-15% but seldom more than that. 

The reasoning there is a simple one: diversification. One stock in a tailspin can be buoyed by performance elsewhere in the account/portfolio. Makes all the sense in the world.

What I want to ask is if these numbers don't depend on your total portfolio value?

An example would be a 14,000 USD account value (e.g., in an IRA wrapper for argument) versus 56,000+ USD.

With the former, you'll be looking at maybe 1-2 shares per stock if you allocate each holding to 5%. Decades-long, reliable blue chips can readily orbit 200-500 USD/share, e.g., UNH, MA et cetera.

Is there not an argument that one smartly leans rather 15-30% per holding you've done due diligence on to see appreciation in value? Or is that generally frowned on where the far fewer of 1-2 shares is better?

It seems a disservice to have so little skin in each stock but hence, my ask. Thanks.",investing,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ehhzcw/portfolio_question_on_stock_holdings/
wendru,Continue investing in VWCE or Roth IRA as a PhD student in the US?,1722523424,1ehifrm,0,1,"This is my situation.

1. I am European, 24-years old. My investment goals are long-term (40-50 years; for retirement).

2. I have been investing in VWCE for the past year using IBKR.

3. I will be moving to the US this month to start my PhD. I will be on a F-1 visa. I will be receiving a stipend also.

4. I understand that maintaining European domiciled ETFs during my stay in the US is not ideal due to PFIC.  However, I believe for the first five years, I will be classified as a ""nonresident for tax purposes"" for the first five calendar years. Therefore, I think I can keep investing in VWCE if I would like to. Once those five years are up, PFIC will start to ""kick in"".

5. If I do want to keep investing in VWCE during my PhD, currency conversion fees (Dollars to Euros) should not be an issue (I have Revolut).

5. I am also aware that I am eligible for Roth IRAs. My home country recognises the tax-free nature of Roth IRA.

6. I am not convinced that I will be staying in the US post-PhD. 

Therefore, I am not sure what is the ""smart thing"" to do at this point. Should I keep investing in VWCE? Or should I make use of the tax advantages stemming from Roth IRA (which would also make sense if I do stay in the US)?   
I am open to any advice. Thanks!

Upbeat_Variety8531,Best investment approach for retiring under 55?,1722523670,1ehij99,0,17,"

So I have been following this sub and the Boglehead strategy and approach which I love.

1. I took the first step and opened a roth ira at fidelity and threw in $7k into spaxx until i figure out my fund allocation. 

2. Since i am at the $140k-$160k income range I have also started contributing 2k a month into my companies 401k. The fund selection is small but If i want to qualify for a for a roth ira contribution I have no choice. (Going to probably go with fxaix and save my roth ira for something else instead of voo bc of the overlap)


3. Dilemma and details
- currently mid 30s and plan to retire before 55 and adopt perhaps fire, coastfire or barista fire plan.

- No debt at all or student loans 

- 6 month HYSA emergency savings established

- Live in CA, currently in 24% tax bracket 


4. Thus I am wondering if the standard roth ira and 401k approach is still the best option for someone who is looking to retire before 59.

TLDR: Wish to access investments prior 59, wondering if locking 25% of my income in a 401k and roth ira is going to back fire since I can't touch those retirement accounts without penalties.

It's a fantastic tool designed for real estate investors, it breaks essential components such as cashflow, principal paydown, home appreciation, reno appreciation, initial equity, and potential tax savings and showcases their individual gains and ROI over a 30-year period. This allows you to easily identify which factors provide the highest returns, helping you make informed investment decisions.  
  
One particularly useful feature is the ROI Indicator, visually representing the strength of the ROI through color-coded cells, providing a quick assessment of potential investments. Green cells indicate a strong ROI, red cells signify a poor ROI, and orange cells suggest an acceptable ROI.

**Business Overview:**

BAE Systems plc is a global defence, aerospace, and security company headquartered in the UK. Founded in 1999 through the merger of British Aerospace and Marconi Electronic Systems, BAE Systems has grown to become one of the world's largest defence contractors. 

At the core of BAE Systems' business model is its ability to design, manufacture, and support advanced defence systems across air, maritime, land, and cyber domains. The company's diverse portfolio and strong relationships with government customers, particularly in the US, UK, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, provide a solid foundation for sustained growth. BAE Systems operates through five main segments:

1. **Electronic Systems (25% of H1 2024 sales):** Electronic Systems encompasses a wide range of advanced electronic solutions developed in both the US and UK. This segment produces electronic warfare systems that protect military platforms from various threats, alongside navigation systems for military and commercial applications. It also creates electro-optical sensors for surveillance and targeting, as well as military and commercial digital engine and flight controls. The division specialises in precision guidance and seeker solutions for missiles and smart munitions, next-generation military communications systems and data links, and persistent surveillance capabilities. With the recent acquisition of Ball Aerospace, the segment has expanded its offerings to include space electronics, spacecraft, and ground systems. Additionally, it develops electric drive propulsion systems, further broadening its technological portfolio.
2. **Platforms & Services (16% of H1 2024 sales):** Operating primarily in the US, Sweden, and the UK, Platforms & Services focuses on the manufacture and upgrade of combat vehicles, weapons, and munitions. Key products include the Armoured Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) for the U.S. military, the CV90 family of combat vehicles, and various artillery systems. This segment also provides crucial services such as naval ship repair and sustainment activities. A unique aspect of this division is its management and operation of two government-owned ammunition plants for the U.S. Army, underlining its importance in the defence supply chain.
3. **Air (30% of H1 2024 sales):** The Air segment is at the forefront of combat aircraft and future air system technologies. It plays a significant role in the production of the Eurofighter Typhoon and the F-35 Lightning II, providing both airframes and electronic systems. The segment is deeply involved in the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), working on developing next-generation fighter aircraft. Beyond new production, it offers support and upgrades for in-service aircraft fleets and operates the FalconWorks organisation, which conducts research into innovative aerospace technologies.
4. **Maritime (22% of H1 2024 sales):** Maritime comprises the Group's UK-based maritime and land activities, along with its Australian operations. This segment is responsible for major submarine and ship build programs, as well as their ongoing support. Key projects include the Astute and Dreadnought class submarines for the UK Royal Navy, the Type 26 frigate, and the Hunter class frigate for Australia. The division also develops autonomous and unmanned maritime systems, provides naval ship repair and modernisation services, and delivers maritime combat systems and radar integration solutions.
5. **Cyber & Intelligence (9% of H1 2024 sales):** Cyber & Intelligence consists of the US-based Intelligence & Security business and the UK-headquartered Digital Intelligence business.

thumbtackcapital,PNBK at 0.16 PB: Overblown fears on CECL and nonperforming loans?,1727328253,1fpowkz,0,1,"**Hey everyone, wanted to share my thesis on PNBK from last month. Stock is still sitting at my buy price, so there's still plenty of opportunity here for anyone interested in a bank that's priced like it's going out of business. Worth a look.**

Thesis Date: Aug. 29, 2024

Patriot National Bancorp is the holding company of a small Connecticut bank with 11 branches that barely made it through the GFC. Despite some rough earnings since then, it's still standing. In 2022, PNBK's planned acquisition by fintech startup American Challenger fell through, reportedly due to regulatory delays. The idea was for American Challenger to merge into PNBK and use PNBK's existing customer base to roll out new digital banking products.

Thanks to sizeable changes in loss provision due to the adoption of CECL in early 2023 ([wiping $13M of equity](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1098146/000162828024013983/pnbk-20231231.htm#:~:text=The%20increase%20was%20primarily%20due%20to%20the%20adoption%20of%20CECL%20as%20the%20Company%20recorded%20a%20transition%20adjustment%20of%20%2413.0%20million%20effective%20January%201%2C%202023)), and quickly increasing nonperforming CRE loans (5% of CRE loans were nonperforming as of the last 10-Q), the company is now priced for a doomsday scenario. As of today, the bank trades at 0.16 PB, which means one of two things must happen at some point in the future:

1. The bank reports massive impairments (increased loss provisions), wiping most of the $41M of equity. This would mean either that:
   * the bank's internal controls have failed,
   * their auditor is incompetent,
   * there is a systemic breakdown in the CRE market causing havoc country-wide, or
   * the bank is purposely failing to disclose writedowns in a timely manner
2. The price goes up significantly as the positive trend in nonperforming CRE loans fails to create sizeable impairments, and the equity is revalued at a higher PB.

The stock is extremely illiquid (0.2% of float trades per day on average) and the market cap is a measly $7M. Due to the small size, delisting could occur which is a real market risk for some investors.

I have a feeling that I may be missing something important here. The increasing nonperforming loans might be a sign of bigger problems ahead, or maybe this bank has no idea how to set loss reserves while the market does. However, this seems unlikely. Why would the market know better than the bank? If the market knows better than management and so values the equity at $7M, why not value it at $3M or $1M? It was surprising to find out that there is virtually no short interest on this stock.

[Expected loss ratio and Nonperforming assets ratio chart](https://thumbtackcapital.com/images/PNBK_1.jpg)

>*Expected loss ratio = Allowance for credit losses ÷ Gross loans receivable*

>*Nonperforming assets ratio = Total nonperforming assets ÷ Gross loans receivable (using NPA instead of NPL for simplicity/conservatism)*

>*Looking at past results, nonperforming assets don't necessarily translate into writedowns. I'm not saying there won't be losses, just that given the track record, they seem unlikely to materialize to such an extent that a 0.16 PB is reasonable. Perhaps being a small community bank, PNBK has strong relationships with its customers and believes that current accounting standards do not accurately reflect the bank's ability to work-out nonperforming loans. Hence such a divergence in the two ratios.*

The CFO (J.P.) runs a locksmithing company and owns virtually no shares, which makes me think he has little incentive to make the accountants manipulate earnings (not to mention his strong disincentive to preside over material misstatements). The earnings aren't great, and the bank is nowhere near recovering the losses from the GFC. They also recently laid off 20% of staff. Yet no other bank trades at such a steep discount to stated book value (the next lowest PB in the industry is 0.34—more than double).

JonathanGKC,Pfizer(pfe) Undervalued ,1727342910,1fps4il,0,51,"It’s puzzling to see Pfizer (PFE) stock currently trading so low around $28.50 when all indicators point toward much higher valuations. For a company that has generated over $100 billion in revenue during the pandemic that fueled investment like the Seagen acquisition and continues to show robust growth in its core products, the current price level seems disconnected from its true value.

Pfizer’s diverse portfolio, including blockbusters like **Eliquis**, **Prevnar**, and cancer therapies, alongside its expansion into biotech with the **Seagen acquisition**, supports a strong future. Even excluding COVID-related sales, the company’s non-pandemic drugs generate billions in steady revenue annually. With oncology advances and digital innovations accelerating productivity and growth, the stock is undervalued relative to its potential.

### 1. **Current Performance Overview**
In 2022, Pfizer generated a record $100.3 billion in revenue, driven by its COVID-19 vaccine **Comirnaty** and antiviral treatment **Paxlovid**. While the pandemic-related demand is waning, these products still contributed significant sales:  
- **Comirnaty**: $37.8 billion  
- **Paxlovid**: $18.9 billion  

However, even excluding these COVID-related products, Pfizer has a robust pipeline and portfolio that supports a strong growth outlook.

### 2. **Core Products**
Several key drugs continue to drive solid revenue:
- **Eliquis** (anticoagulant): $6.5 billion
- **Prevnar family** (vaccines): $6.3 billion
- **Ibrance** (cancer treatment): $5.1 billion
- **Vyndaqel** (for heart conditions): $2.4 billion  

Collectively, these core drugs generate about $20 billion annually, showcasing the stability in Pfizer's non-COVID business segments.

### 3. **Oncology Pipeline & Seagen Acquisition**
Pfizer's recent acquisition of Seagen strengthens its oncology portfolio, adding advanced cancer therapies and a technology platform for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). This move doubles its oncology pipeline and positions it to potentially dominate this lucrative segment. Seagen alone could add over $10 billion in revenue by 2030, as Pfizer focuses on cancer treatments for prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and other indications.

### 4. **Long-Term Growth Potential**
Pfizer is rapidly advancing in its digital transformation efforts, leveraging AI for drug discovery and operational efficiency, which could unlock an additional $750 million to $1 billion in near-term value. Coupled with innovations in oncology, vaccines, and gene therapy, Pfizer’s diversified approach to medicine ensures it will continue to grow and provide strong shareholder value.

### 5. **Justifying minimum $40 Price Target**
Using conservative estimates:
- **Non-COVID revenues** are projected to grow steadily from around $45 billion annually.
- With future oncology revenues from the Seagen acquisition and other pipeline products, Pfizer could generate over $50 billion in stable revenue post-2024.
- Assuming a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 9x on estimated future earnings of $5 per share, Pfizer stock could easily justify a $40 share price.

### Closing Remarks:
I firmly believe this is an amazing opportunity to invest in. Pfizer is well-positioned to capitalize on its current strengths, future innovations, and strong cash flow. A target price of $40 is not only realistic but conservative given its trajectory. The current market price provides an exceptional entry point, and those who recognize this will likely see significant gains as the market corrects this undervaluation.",ValueInvesting,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fps4il/pfizerpfe_undervalued/

1) EPS is now $4/year and dropping. Dividend $2.71/year. I don't like that ratio.
2) Total debt is up to $175 billion. They have $2 billion in cash. They are paying $20 billion for Frontier, and at the same time will assume Frontier's debt, which is $11 billion. So Verizon's debt is about to skyrocket even more. Verizon's management is insistent on maintaining and even increasing the dividend. That makes no sense to me.

MrAccord,What I learned about AI Over the Last Year,1726341696,1fgtqj2,0,343,"For about a year now I've been trying to learn more about what AI can really offer to the economy.  I don't have a tech or engineering background.  In conversation with tech guys, I'd get met with, ""WHAT?  HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THE VALUE OF NVIDIA'S GPUS???""  There is never an explanation of what AI is supposed to do for company ABC and why its stock should trade at a multiple of 80 for it.

In the past year of my research work, I learned quite a few key points that I thought I would share in one spot today, stuff about the AI economy and what role different companies play:

GPUs are better for AI than CPUs.  While invented for the toll of processing visuals in video games, the GPU's general feature is being able to process parallel tasks.  CPU processing is more like a straight line.  AI runs better on a GPU because of that difference.

Even among GPUs, there are differences.  For AI purposes, their are two basic processes: 

1. Training: Essentially the ""deep learning"" part, where AI is fed data or trial-and-error to build its model.

2. Inferencing: Where AI, equipped with a model, assesses situations and applies it in real-time.

Nvidia's chips are much better for training, but AMD's are better for inferencing.  While trends and cycles for AI are not yet clear, the consequence for investors is that NVDA and AMD may rise and fall on the same cycles.

Intel essentially has almost no way to compete with this, but they continue produce most of the semiconductors out there for everything else we still use.  Because they had fallen behind, Pat Gelsinger came into try and turn Intel around, mainly by building up its foundry business.

On that note, NVDA and AMD do not manufacture the entire chip, just their proprietary components, as do other businesses.  The silicon wafers that go into the chips are manufactured at a foundry.  Intel has its own vertically integrated foundries, but NVDA and AMD do not, making them ""fabless.""  Taiwan Semiconductor Company is the global leader in this spot, as a foundry pure play.  They control roughly 60% of the global market.  Companies like ASML, meanwhile, design and manufacture the machines that are used at foundries.

Intel hopes to develop its foundries beyond its own capacity and to sell this service to fabless makers, which includes folks like Nvidia and AMD.  Many doubt how consistently they would be willing to do business with a major competitor, so now there is talk that the Intel foundry business might be spun off into a separate entity.

The foundry-level stuff is more capital intensive, and this is why NVDA and AMD have seen much more appreciation and higher multiples.  They have no capex committed to the foundries and can increase volume at margins that feel like printing money.  Foundry-level companies still enjoy high volume, but their tighter margins have generally led to less of a premium than the likes of NVDA or AMD.

That's just the semiconductor side.  Why does AI make them money?  They answer is that most business can shave millions off of the operating expenses or increase volume with AI.  AI can speed up repetitive tasks or can find data trends in their business that were previously not possible, thereby improving a company's strategy.

So almost every sales team for every industry can get more bookings.  Almost every shipping route and warehouse will move goods more efficiently.  Of course, entirely new software services will be able to exist too.

Whether these companies use cloud services or their own internal systems, this means data centers are being built and scaled up like never before to support the processing these GPUs will do.  Companies like Dell and HP can offer server products to this end.  Oracle offers cloud services that are ideal for training.  Even electric companies have a role to play in supplying these data centers with energy, 24/7.  Some nuclear companies are being considered as a green alternative, as solar and wind are not constantly available.

They are all large cap in their respective industries with (in my opinion) seemingly reasonable fundamentals.

If it's any consolation for myself, all of them have been paying some dividends yearly.

* The portfolio is a total of 28 stocks. 3 consumer discretionary, 3 consumer staples, 2 financials, 4 industrials, 4 materials, 3 healthcare, 9 technology. 

* Each position is equal weight.

* I can only pick from the tech stocks listed below because of specific screening requirements.

* I am trying to diversify the tech holdings so they aren't all in very similar businesses. 

* This is a long term portfolio. Changes can be made in the future as needed, but I plan on DCA'ing into this on a monthly basis for the foreseeable future. 

Other considerations:

* I am clearly overweight tech. I am a big believer in tech outperforming in the long run. 

* I will be creating/investing in this portfolio with M1 finance, meaning I can create pies/ETFs with up to 100 stocks per pie/ETF. I can theoretically include as many tech stocks as I want and include that pie/ETF as a percentage of the overall portfolio.

I'm investing in traditional index ETFs for stocks (I use VDC, which is consumer defensive, rather than a total stock market ETF), bonds (VGSH, TLT), gold (GLD), and commodities (DBC). I have also invested in real estate. Tony Robbins' new book The Holy Grail of Investing recommends 7 more uncorrelated investments that are new to me. (Summary at: [https://theintel.org/Tony-Robbins-Uncorrelated-investments-now-available-to-Average-Joe/](https://theintel.org/Tony-Robbins-Uncorrelated-investments-now-available-to-Average-Joe/) )  His book also claims that Congress is changing the rules regarding who can qualify as an ""accredited investor"" to access these types of investments. Because of their risk, investors are required to have $1M in assets or $250k/yr in income to access these investments. Soon, we will apparently be able to take a test to become a qualified investor, bypassing the wealth requirements. Myself, I'm in the process of assessing if these 7 new investment strategies are simply too risky, or if including them in my portfolio will reduce my portfolio risk overall. Please comment if you have used these investment vehicles previously limited to ""qualified investors"" or suggest other types of uncorrelated investment opportunities.

I am 63 years old and I have a few investment questions I’m hoping this community can help me with. I would like to invest 50k with a hard money real estate lender, expecting a projected return of 8-11% per year.

I have three sources that I could use for the investment:
1.) A self directed IRA (SDIRA)
2.) 401k
3.) Edward Jones account

My money accounts are invested 65/35 in age appropriate investments. I would try to keep the ratio the same using the conservative money from those accounts.

My questions are as follows:

1.) Do they withhold taxes at the time of the withdrawal from 401k and Ed Jones?

1a.) If so, how much would I have to withdraw to net 50k? I’m in the 24% tax bracket.

2.) One CPA advised against using SDIRA money. I believe it creates a UBIT tax? Not sure what that is but other than that I’m not sure why.

3.) Is it a bad idea to withdraw the money now at my age? It will be reinvested conservatively.

But, this gives me no money to invest in my ROTH to get a 4% match. So i'm considering stopping funding my HSA above the employer match and instead starting to fund my ROTH to get the 4% match up to the yearly allowable limit.

QuantWeekly,Give me your portfolio and I will try to balance it.,1722346914,1eftni5,0,1,"Frequently retail investors come here and ask for opinions on their portfolios. Now, I am a very opinionated man who happens to be stress-testing his computer model for Markowitz optimization. It is very important to understand that I am also a retail investor (and blogger). I am not a financial advisor and not certified to give out financial advice. Thus all my answers here are strictly my personal opinion.

Now let's lay out some ground rules:
1. I'll do up to five securities. As I the process is only semi-automated I have to put in some manual work.
2. I will do stocks, rated bonds and etfs. I am not touching crypto. If you are looking into an unrated bond please estimate a rating. If the bond you are looking into is rated please provide that rating as those are surprisingly difficult to find in many cases.
3. Whenever possible please provide the ISIN instead of the ticker symbol.

I will make the following assumptions:
1. The securities are assumed to perform as they did over the past five years. If you believe a security will perform differently than it did over the past 5 years please specify that.
2. For companies in the same industry I will assume a correlation of 0.7, for companies in unrelated field I will assume 0.3 unless specified otherwise in your request. For etfs I will also generally assume 0.3. Bond returns are estimated to be uncorrelated with any other type of security or each other.
3. For an estimated rating I will use Moody's default rates.
4. I am taking the dividend estimations for 2024 as well as the volatility from the ING website.

Do you think we will see more upside from small cap ETFs? Do you think these current levels will persist? How many of you have made gains on this small cap rally?

HaltingAnkl,Cryptocurrency mentorship ,1722427420,1eglfif,0,1,"I recently discovered an online crypto mentor who has been a game-changer for my trading journey. They provide personalized guidance, walking me through trades and sharing valuable signals. The best part? I've actually made profits with their help!

The mentor's pricing model is transparent and fair - they charge a percentage-based fee, ranging from 12-15%, only after I've made profits. This aligns their interests with mine, ensuring they're invested in my success.

I'm curious to know if anyone else in the community uses mentors or premium services for crypto trading. What have your experiences been like? Have you found it helpful to have expert guidance and support?

I believe that having a mentor has not only improved my trading skills but also reduced my stress levels. It's reassuring to have someone with expertise in my corner, helping me navigate the volatile crypto market.

If you're struggling to make consistent profits or feeling overwhelmed by market analysis, I highly recommend considering a mentor or premium service. It might be the key to unlocking your trading potential.

Born_Vacation7154,Exploring Investment Opportunities in Regenerative Medicine: Dr. Henry E. Young’s Lab and Stem Cell Research,1722529664,1ehkze3,0,1,"Hello r/investing,

I recently came across an interesting development in the field of regenerative medicine that I thought might be worth discussing from an investment perspective. Dr. Henry E. Young, a scientist known for his work with universal telomerase-positive stem cells, is in the process of re-establishing his lab in the U.S. His research aims to develop 3D growth plate implants, which have the potential to revolutionize treatments for growth disorders and possibly even offer a method for adults to increase their height.

While I’m not here to promote or solicit investments directly, I think this area presents intriguing possibilities for investors. The biotech sector, particularly regenerative medicine, has shown substantial growth and interest in recent years. The potential market applications of such innovative treatments could be vast, including healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and beyond.

Given the complexities and risks associated with biotech investments, I’m curious about the community’s thoughts on the viability of investing in emerging technologies like Dr. Young’s. What are the key factors you consider when evaluating investment opportunities in early-stage biotech companies? How do you assess the potential risks versus rewards in such speculative sectors?

Looking forward to an informative and civil discussion on the prospects and challenges of investing in cutting-edge medical research.

21_Points,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,1722535915,1ehnkfo,0,4,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

Is it even worth worrying about my Roth IRA at this point since investing in my education is my number one priority?

",1727355963,1fpvpyh,0,1,"Mocksville, North Carolina—(Newsfile Corp. - September 25, 2024) - 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: $XXII), a pioneering tobacco products company focused on providing consumers with choices about their nicotine consumption, has announced a significant commitment from an existing customer to supply filtered cigar products. This expansion aligns with the company's strategic efforts to enhance its product portfolio and meet growing consumer demand.

Under this new agreement, 22nd Century will take on the production of all filtered cigar products for the customer, utilizing an in-house predicate blend. This move not only streamlines production but also ensures quality control throughout the manufacturing process. Initial shipments are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024, with annual volumes projected to exceed 200,000 cartons. This represents a substantial addition to the company’s production capabilities and is expected to significantly enhance profitability.

This new commitment follows an earlier agreement with the same customer, which focused on exporting conventional cigarette products. This previous deal is expected to contribute an additional 20% to the overall contract manufacturing business volumes. As production ramps up, 22nd Century anticipates steady increases in output throughout the remainder of 2024 and a substantial surge in 2025.

With pre-market trading volume reaching 34,221 shares, the market is responding positively to the news. Investors are keenly interested in how these developments will impact the company's growth trajectory and profitability. The dual focus on both filtered cigars and conventional cigarette exports positions 22nd Century as a versatile player in the tobacco industry, catering to a diverse customer base.

As the tobacco landscape continues to evolve, 22nd Century Group remains committed to leading the fight against nicotine addiction while offering smokers choices that suit their preferences. By expanding its CMO business and enhancing its product offerings, the company aims to strengthen its market position and deliver value to its shareholders.

The future looks promising for 22nd Century Group, as it leverages existing customer relationships and expands its production capabilities. With initial shipments on the horizon and strong projected growth, investors and industry analysts alike will be closely monitoring the company’s progress in the coming quarters.",ValueInvesting,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fpvpyh/22nd_century_group_expands_product_line_with_new/

photon_lines,PagSeguro Digital - Great Value and Growth Potential,1727360201,1fpx9j4,0,3,"Hi guys - I wanted to get some of your thoughts on another stock which I think is being ignored by Mr. Market, which is PagSeguro Digital (ticker PAGS). It's a Brazilian financial technology company focused on providing digital payment solutions and banking services. It started off as being a payments focused processor (like Square) for Brazil / Latin America, but has recently expanded it's offerings and now offers a comprehensive ecosystem of financial services, which includes digital banking (PagBank), payment processing, credit products, investment services, and insurance. Its payment services span point-of-sale (POS) devices, online gateways, cross-border payments, and Brazil's instant payment system, PIX. In other words, their eco-system is vertically integrated and quite broad and they're working on expanding it.

**Key Points and Business Highlights:**

* Payment volume has been growing without much hindrance since the companies inception (last 5 years # of transactions processed: 115B,  162B, 252B, 354B, 394B) which represents around 44% of it's total revenue and offers instant settlement (the only banking which has this offering). Revenue has also grown from \~1.3 billion to now \~3.4 billion during last 3-4 years along with strong net income growth (grown from \~210 million to \~370 million during that same period).
* PagBank has 30 million users (2nd largest digital bank in Brazil) a 19% increase from 24.8 million a year earlier and is still expanding its client base. It includes a complete investment platform which allows clients to buy Stocks / REITs, Treasury Bonds, 170+ Investment Funds, PagBank CDs and offers many other services (including education and financial advisory) and is partnering with other institutions to offer other products like insurance / health assistance / education. 
* The users love the application (4.9 rating in app store and 4.7 play in Google play).
* Company has been profitable **every single quarter** since its IPO. It has generated a net income of around 100 million during last 3 quarters. The current market cap is \~2.8 billion dollars gives it a forward price to earnings of \~8 which is insanely low for a company with this type of growth packaged with an outstanding product and profitability. 
* It has also recently announced a 200 million share-buyback program.
* Recent analyst down-grade (by Morgan Stanley) has put the shares at extremely discounted valuation. Their claim is that the competition in this space is saturated and their new price target to me is absolutely abysmal (6 dollars). Even if we were to play out a worst-case scenario for the company, it has had a great ROE (approximately 14 percent) since inception and has been growing its user base and offerings, so the downside from this point is extremely limited. Even if the user base and income stay steady, the company has enough in income to purchase 1 billion dollars (on half of the current float) worth of shares in just a 3-year period.  38% of the float is owned by a private firm and many institutions also own a lot of shares (including Ryan Cohen's Point72 Asset Management) and have steadily been adding to their positions.",ValueInvesting,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fpx9j4/pagseguro_digital_great_value_and_growth_potential/

It has seemingly underperformed relative to its peers post-Covid. Some mishaps with their D2C strategy, cutting out agents and losing business travel. The debt levels seemingly paint the picture of a constrained balance sheet, mixed with losses rather than profits in recent times. 

However, long-term, are they likely to become irrelevant? I see some consolidation happening with Hawaii/alaska airlines. Spirit seems to be in a tough spot. Surely as one of the big four, operating in an industry that’s pretty competitive and capital intensive as a barrier to entry, it could climb back to a better position?

i4value,Engtex – chasing dreams or using base rates?,1727137710,1fnzspc,0,4,"Daniel Kahneman made famous the concept of the base rate fallacy. When presented with both historical or statistical information and those which is specific to an event, we tend to ignore the historical/statistical one. 



I worry that we are going to see this play out for Engtex. This is a cyclical company whose performance is linked to steel prices. So in valuing Engtex we should be looking at its performance over the steel cycle. On such a basis  its earnings value based on its historical performance is below its market price suggesting that it is overpriced



Of course, you would argue that this is backward looking and a more forward looking picture should consider the potential demand for water pipes. This in turn relates to the increase in water rates that would translate into better earnings for the water companies that in turn spur more water infra spending. On such a basis, you would consider Engtex as being underpriced.



In the short term the water infra story may play out. But if you are a long-term fundamental investor, shouldn’t you be looking at the water infra story in the context of the base rates?

Brief-Frosting405,What is wrong with Target?,1727140967,1fo0uqo,0,56,"I’m curious as to what I am missing here. I’m going to do some comparing to Walmart as they are Target’s most natural competitor in my opinion.

Target trades at a P/E of 16x and a P/FCF of 13.5x. Walmart trades at a P/E of 41x and a P/FCF of 54x.

Target also has better margins across the board than Walmart. Gross - 26.11% vs. 24.63%, operating - 5.79% vs. 4.25%, and net - 4.18% vs. 2.34%. 

Walmart is growing faster, but I don’t think by an amount that justifies the massive premium in valuation. Target EPS growth for the next 5 years is expected to be 8.2% while Walmart is expected to be 10.1%.

Now for some qualitative analysis. I prefer shopping at Target. I think the store is less depressing and more enjoyable. Walmart feels like some dystopian nightmare out of a struggling eastern block country. Target doesn’t feel amazing, but it feels significantly better than Walmart in my opinion.

Lastly, I noticed that Target’s short interest is 3.15% vs. Walmart’s 0.98%. So I ask, what’s wrong with Target?",ValueInvesting,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fo0uqo/what_is_wrong_with_target/

Instead, I'm contributing a little bit to it here and there with after-tax money; whatever I can after the bills are paid (I have my emergency fund as well).

MarkusEF,"In my humble opinion, Generative A.I. is the most idiotic bubble I’ve seen so far.",1708631923,1axfzb7,0,1,"There was the generalized Internet bubble of the 1990s, in which any company that added a .com to its name would see its shares skyrocket. Then came the Web 2.0 / social media bubble of the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s.   
Compared to recent “new technological paradigms,” Generative A.I. seems to have the narrowest use cases, is prone to errors/hallucinations, and is not even a novel concept. Benzinga has been publishing A.I.-generated articles regarding stock price movements, analyst estimates, earnings results, etc. for years before the marketing buzzword “generative A.I.“ became mainstream. You can tell they’re A.I.-generated because they follow a cookie-cutter template and provide few novel insights. I’ve been thoroughly unimpressed with the essays generated by ChatGPT & the like; not only do they contain occasional errors (hallucinations), they’re far from the quality of papers written by competent humans. ChatGPT might be useful for below-average university students to get by, but I don’t see how its use cases are a $10 trillion+ market. For now, seemingly every Fortune 500 company has jumped on the A.I. bandwagon, as simply mentioning A.I. on investor calls automatically leads to increased valuations.

  
Big Tech is extremely skilled at selling hype & FOMO through a new buzz word every few years. I’m just wondering how long this mania might last before it deflates, as previous manias always do. I imagine first, the non-tech companies paying NVIDIA & the like billions of dollars for A.I. chips & data centers would realize the economic/profit gain from Generative A.I. is not as large as forecasted. Then eventually, it hits the tech companies selling the shovels. But this could take years to play out.

I suppose it depends on the % you sell -- for a small sale %, you still *always* root for the price to go up and never worry about selling a few at the right time.  Just sell and move on.

Up until now, I have been putting my money primarily into a variety of stocks and ETFs. South Africa has some extremely high interest rates on HYSA’s.  8-8.5%.  At this point, would it be a safer bet to put all future earnings into a high-yield savings account rather than buying stocks and ETFs?

LegitimateBoot1395,Where to park money for the medium term? (currency issues),1722622095,1eigxrp,0,1,"Appreciate any thoughts on this. Just about to complete the sale of a property in UK (in GBP).

Currently in US for unknown duration of time. Might stay forever, might move back to London in a couple years. Lots depends on career and how it pans out. I can file for a greencard if I wanted through work but waiting to see what long term plan is given the tax implications of becoming a permanent resident.

What do I do with the money from the sale with a 2-3yr horizon? It is my house deposit fund so cant take too much risk. It is <1M USD, but >500k. It would be mad to leave it doing nothing in cash. The issue is now I am a ""US person"" no banks in the UK will touch me due to the IRS reporting rules. So I can't open a savings or investment account in the UK anymore, unless I move back and say bye to the IRS. There might be some specialist providers but they will be likely to be high fees (think 2%). There are ""offshore"" bonds which allow you to stay denominated in GBP but these feel dodgy to me and I don't want to volunteer myself for an audit!  
  
I could move the money into USD, bring it here and invest. But I might need it 2yrs from now so it seems risky to put into the markets. Additionally, there is a lot of currency risk. Currently there are $1.28 to the GBP, but it could be $1.4 in 2yrs time, or $1:1 even! Any gains from investing could be immediately wiped out by currency shift. Additionally, with a CD I am in a relatively high income tax band here in the US so would lose 1/3 at least of any cash interest paid.

shankartnj,Indian citizen moved back to India from US in July 2023. Looking to learn about tax implications on investments still in US.,1722348720,1efudka,0,1,"I am a Indian Citizen. I am married to a US citizen in Aug 2022. I was in the US for about 12 years under H1B visa (NO GREEN CARD). I moved back to India last year (2023) in July along with my wife, a year after I got married. I still have my ESPP, 401k and personal investments (MFs and ETFs) in the US. I don't have plans to do anything with my 401K for now other than rolling it over to an IRA. So I am not worried about that. But I am a little worried about company stock that I accumulated through ESPP and personal investments. Because I saw in some places the international tax rate in 30% for international investors. I want to sell especially the ESPP, so I can diversify. And I have a few questions, I am looking to get answered and hope the community can help me with this. Considering I am in India now, 

1. Generally, what are the taxes for international investors? 
   1. Do international investors not have the ability to claim long term capital gains? 
2. I also recently learnt of the W-8BEN (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) which is to be submitted to the brokerages for proper withholding. 
   1. When am I supposed to submit this form? 
   2. And what am I supposed to fill in the ""Special rates and conditions"" condition? I am reading through the US-India tax treaty (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/india.pdf). But it is all Greek and Latin to me. Does anyone have any experience with this type of thing? Do I need to fill anything in the special rates and conditions section?
3. How does it work if my wife who is a US citizen files taxes for us jointly? Or is it even possible to file jointly, if I am not a US person and we are both out of the country?",investing,0.27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1efudka/indian_citizen_moved_back_to_india_from_us_in/

My previous job offered a 401k with Empower. My new job offers a 403b with TIAA. I was looking to rollover the 401k funds (~$60k) to the 403b, but the Empower rep advised that I could leave the 401k alone, or transfer it to an Empower Roth IRA. I know this is just so they can keep collecting the fees, but the idea of a Roth is attractive. But then again, I don't know what kind of taxes I'd be paying, and I don't know the deep ins and outs of 401ks/403bs/Roth's to determine which choice to make. 

Is it a good idea to just roll everything over to the 403b?

The biggest takeaway was be bold, brave and never look at it as an overnight get rich scheme. 
So yes, ask me anything and most importantly, start your investing journey as early in your life with as little as you can, just start.",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1alvn09/investing_is_fun_extraordinary/

NeoMachiavell,Is this the perfect time to invest in US private prisons?,1707573813,1anh11d,0,1,"After taking office, Joe Biden signed an executive order preventing the DOJ from signing new contracts with private prisons. Private prison stocks tanked instantly, some as much as 50%. 

A lot has happened since Joe Biden took office, and I believe it is very safe to assume, without political bias, that the next administration is likely to be a Republican one and that Joe Biden's chances of reelection are very slim. 

U.S. crime rate & statistics for 2021 was 6.81, a 6.02% increase from 2020. Also, a republican administration is more likely to be tough on crime, leading to more arrests and probably higher profits for private prisons.

YungPersian,Whirlpool (WHR) and HomeBuying ,1727392439,1fq9t7a,0,2,"We’re currently hearing two pretty different things. Either there will be a recession or things will be fine where it’s not a recession but maybe spending will slow in ‘25 and rates will continually lower. Obviously the recession scenario is a nightmare but you could argue other than utilities it’s a nightmare for pretty much every company. If it’s the scenario where things slow minus a full on recession obviously discretionary spending goes down but if you need an appliance for your new home because it either doesn’t have one or is in serious need of replacement this doesn’t quite fall under that category. 

Buying homes is also not discretionary and we may see home buying increase as rates lower. My goal is to get in earlier before we really see the housing market pick up. Looking at its valuation it’s lower than it was in 2019, there were increases in rates as we all know and supply shortages (chips) that had hit this stock hard in 22-23 from its highs in ‘21-‘22. It seems like there would be runway here, it’s not going to be anything like the pandemic where it boomed because of crazy mortgage rates and people being stuck at home, but there seems to be an opportunity for gradual growth given rates are going to lower. 

It seems less dicey than other home adjacent stocks I’ve been researching like shark ninja which has a pretty high PE, and Wayfair with profitability issues. Those two companies also lean more towards discretionary spending. 

What’s everyone else’s thoughts? Any other pros or cons I’m missing here?

Approximately 95% of its sales come from its loyal membership base, which has around 40 million accounts. Ulta offers a customer-centric in-store experience, contributing to its significant ""share of mind"" among American consumers.
While expanding its online customer base, Ulta must also maintain its cultural values and enhance both in-store and online shopping experiences for synergy. The company has a solid financial position with low debt, primarily from store leases, providing a margin of safety against future uncertainties.

Moreover, Ulta has been actively repurchasing shares, with a notable $1.5 billion buyback in 2022, indicating management's preference for buying back stock when it is undervalued.

Far_Beach_5972,"Atkore - here is my analysis, and I would love to hear your counter arguments.",1726414068,1fhf5nc,0,11,"
This small cap company has a market cap of $3 billion. The stock hit an all-time high of $190 per share at the end of March, 2024. Since then, the stock has crashed by 55% and now costs $86. Despite this big drop, the stock has returned 172% over the last 5 years (Approximately 500% return at the peak when the stock cost $190).

The company had abnormally high earnings during the pandemic because supply chain disruptions and other factors put construction projects on hold or delayed. The pandemic meant that the contractors were willing to pay extra to be able to start their construction projects again. This was a big advantage for Atkore because their distribution network across the US is large and this means they can deliver components throughout the country within a short time frame unlike many of their competitors. This extraordinary situation caused supply/demand in the market to become skewed, and the prices of Atkore's components became higher = an extraordinarily high earnings... 
It is not sustainable, and therefore we now also see that turnover and earnings have been falling for the last few years. There is a mean reversion underway, and earnings must return to the normal growth curve. 

Atkore itself has guided with a normalization after FY2025.. The company guides an EBITDA for FY2025 of $650 million.. 
This is how their EBITDA has looked over the past 5 years:
2020 --> $330 million
2021 --> $906 million
2022 --> $1.330 million
2023 --> $1.021 million
2024/LTM --> $857 million.
In other words, they are guiding for an EBITDA for 2025 which is higher than their pre-pandemic EBITDA, but which is also lower than their first year pandemic outlier EBITDA which was in 2021.. I think the number is realistic and it fits well with their own assessment that FY2025 will be the year of normalization.. I believe the $650 million will be the new low.

So if we start from that and plot the numbers into a DCF calculation, we get the valuation below based on the following assumptions:

* In the end, Free Cashflow is the most important thing. Going from EBITDA to FCF is not always easy, as it depends, among other things, on CAPEX, which we do not know, but we can start from history.. In the last 5 years, the company's FCF has fluctuated in a range between 46% - 65% of the company's EBITDA.. So the lowest year FCF was approximately 46% of EBITDA and the highest year it was 65%.... So let's start from the lowest year to be conservative. This means that for FY2025 we will get $299 million in free cash flow based on guidance of $650 million EBITDA.

*FY2025 will be the normalization year, and after that I count on 3 scenarios from future free cash flow growth. My focus is to do it conservatively, so I count on 3% for the bear case, 5% for the base case and 7% for the bull case.

* I calculate 10 years into the future, and a terminal growth rate of 2.5% which follows inflation and US GDP.

* Based on their fundamentals, the company's WACC is approximately 10.7%. 

These assumptions give us a fair value per share of $83 in the bear scenario, $97 in the base scenario and $113 in the bull scenario.
So if you believe that Atkore will only grow their FCF by 3% over the next 10 years, then the stock is currently approximately 4% overvalued. If you believe that they will grow FCF by 7% over the next 10 years, then the stock is currently approximately 32% undervalued.

Atkore buys back many shares. At last report, they increased their buyback program by $75 million, so their total buyback guidance for FY2024 is $325 million. So approximately 10% of their current market cap. It is not sustainable imo, and I think they are aggressive here right now because they think the stock is very underpriced. If you put it down to a more realistic 4% annual buyback program for the next 9 years, then we will see the number of outstanding shares fall by approximately 28%... This means that over the next 9 years, free cash flow per share will increase by 76% in t",ValueInvesting,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fhf5nc/atkore_here_is_my_analysis_and_i_would_love_to/
p6ilek,JD.com Deep Value Update,1726414521,1fhfbyc,0,6,"# Overview

JD is a Chinese ecommerce company competing with Alibaba and Pinduoduo. They are operating a 1P business model where the majority of their revenue comes from selling goods directly to consumers, this gives them more operational control but requires much capital and heavy investments in assets. They have 3 core business segments: JD Retail 83.47% of revenue, JD logistic 14.89% of revenue and New Businesses 1.64% of revenue. JD Retail produces a 4.00% operating margin, JD Logistic 2.80% and New Businesses operates on a loss of (14.40%). JD Retail accounts for the majority of the revenue and profit. They sell everything from gaming computers, phones, household items, jackets etc. Their focus is to provide quality goods with low shipping time and great customer service. Although JD Logistic is not as profitable as the retail segment, it contributes to the success of the retail segment by offering superb logistic service which in turn benefits the retail segment, so the logistic segment is much more valuable to JD than what the books show. New Businesses consist of unicorn projects.

Due to decreased consumer spending in China and increased competition, JD.com has experienced stagnated growth. From 2021 the share price have plunged around 75%. However, JD.com has improved its business structure by reducing costs and increasing gross margin and free cash flow, while also expanding its infrastructure. Given JD.com's great infrastructure and position as a premium supplier, I believe it will benefit once the Chinese economy regains momentum again.

# Quantitative Deep Value

What I find most interesting regarding JD’s balance sheet is their net present value and liquidation value which is very close to the share price. Cash, equivalents and short term investment totaled $28.8 billion as of June 30, 2024. Account receivables is $2.978 billion, Inventory is $9.721 billion, other current assets is $1.916 Billion, PP&E is $10.758 billion, Land is $5.289, Equity Investments is $7.572 billion and Long-term investments is $11.964 Billion. The value of the aforementioned is in total $78.998 billion. After subtracting total liabilities which is $50.044, we get $28.954 Billion in net asset value which equals $18.80 per share or 72% of the current share price ($26.24). The idea is not to hope that JD will liquidate all their assets and stop operating, but rather get an insight to how big the margin of safety is. Free cash flow as of June 30, 2024 for TTM is $7.656 Billion which is $4.97 per share. Assuming that the free cash flow will not grow in the future it would take you 1.5 years to get back your investment in assets (excluding intangible assets and goodwill etc) and free cash flow. (Share price - Net Asset Value) / FCF = ($26.24 - $18.80 = $7.44 ⇒ $7.44 / $4.97 = 1.50). If we account for a discount rate of 10% (WACC) it would take just under 2 years.

# Moat analysis

Over the last 20 years, JD.com has aggressively invested in logistics, and I believe their investments have created a moat that is very hard to come by. JD.com’s logistics network consists of: 75 000 trucks, 2 000 cloud warehouses, 1 600 warehouses and 350 000 in-house delivery personnel; An asset heavy business model to say the least. This infrastructure enables JD.com to deliver orders placed before 11:00 AM the same day, and orders placed after 11:00 PM the following day reaching nearly every corner in China. JD is a clear leader in logistic in China compared to their competitors.

I'm reading that it's better to look at a company's free cash flow to find out how much it has to work with because it shows liquid cash on hand instead of just assets that might not be as liquid - And that a surplus allows for more cash to be distributed for things like dividends and other things.

But something tells me that Net Cash Flow would be a more accurate estimate because it factors in (operating, investing, and financing activities). So if those accounts are negative, then the business might actually have less money to work with than what FCF would show.  Free Cash Flow only looks at Operating Cash minus Capital Expenditures. 

  
I have this definition I found online below that sparked this question

""*Difference between (Net Cash Flow) and (Free Cash Flow)*

*Free cash flow focuses on cash from operations minus capital expenditures. It measures how much cash is available for distributions after money invested to maintain or expand the business. Net cash flow looks at the total change in cash and cash equivalents based on all business activities.*""

Fullmetalx117,The Simple Case for RDDT,1727248296,1foyjxg,0,29,"I consider Reddit among the top 5 most important sites on the internet today. It has successfully consolidated forums sites from late 90s/2000s into a single site. It has also turned into the best “news aggregation/discussion site”. All the discussion boards for websites like from ESPN (nba particularly) are now on Reddit. 

It’s a growing database of democratized knowledge gathered from around the world. Apparently Altman doesn’t have a stake in OpenAI but has an 8% stake in Reddit - I suspect this will be his wealth vehicle as he likely sees Reddit data as key in future dominated by LLMs/AI. 

Not many earning reports out yet but everything so far is stellar. No debt, fantastic growth, priced reasonably simply comparing EV against peers. Metrics like 9x forward sales seem expensive but in my opinion this is where the value is - my thesis is that Reddit has mostly been undermonetized since existence. They didn’t need to because they didn’t have to. Quality companies with a moat will always have the ability to monetize in the future when they want, they just don’t have to right now. Netflix stayed away from ads until now where they are essentially the new age cable. For the longest time people thought they wouldn’t do that as it’s not their business model - well actually their goal wasn’t really to make profit at the time, it was to grow user base. Spotify WILL monetize which is why they have a high valuation. And I believe Reddit belongs in this same bucket. 

This is not like twitter where only celebrities thrive. This is the world encyclopedia, where people are constantly adding to the database. Reddit earnings are set to do well with election cycle and it’s also a bet on the internet as more people around the world continue to get access to the internet. As people get more leisure time, they will have more time browse Reddit. At the very least I expect it to track the market, if you believe in tech/internet long term. 

Timing IPOs are always tricky with insider sales, the float getting in order, etc. But have established full position in mid 50s and ready to add on major trend tests. ",ValueInvesting,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1foyjxg/the_simple_case_for_rddt/

# 1.    Coal market:

While environmental policies and ESG initiatives are pushing for the eventual phase-out of hydrocarbon fossil fuels like coal, this shift may still be years away. In the meantime, the demand for coal, particularly metallurgical coal (met coal), remains robust, driven by global steel production needs. Despite divestments from coal by some large investors, met coal continues to play a critical role in infrastructure and industrial growth, especially in emerging economies.

Met coal is indispensable in steelmaking, and its demand is expected to persist as global construction and industrial activities continue. For a more detailed analysis of the coal market and its investment opportunities, check out my full thesis below:

[https://smallcaptreasures.substack.com/p/the-forgotten-commodity-coals-quiet](https://smallcaptreasures.substack.com/p/the-forgotten-commodity-coals-quiet)

# 2.    Introduction:

Warrior Met Coal (NYSE: HCC) is one of the leading producers and exporters of premium-quality metallurgical coal in the United States, specializing in coal used exclusively for steelmaking. The company emerged from the bankruptcy of Walter Energy in 2015, successfully transforming its core assets into a financially stable entity under the leadership of CEO Walter Scheller. With a strong focus on operational efficiency and cost management, Warrior Met Coal has generated consistent free cash flow, returning $1.4 billion to stockholders since 2017, and maintains a healthy balance sheet with a net cash position of $550 million.

The company operates two active underground mines in Alabama’s Blue Creek coal seam, renowned for its high-quality coking coal with low sulfur content and strong coking properties. This coal is comparable to the premium Hard Coking Coal (HCC) mined in Australia, giving Warrior a strategic advantage in the global market. A key growth driver for the company is its Blue Creek Mine expansion, which is expected to increase production capacity by 60% and extend production for another 50 years. The expansion, projected to be fully operational by mid-2026, could boost Warrior’s annual output from 8 million tonnes to 12.8 million tonnes.

With its strategic location near the port of Mobile, Alabama, Warrior Met Coal capitalizes on its ability to ship coal globally via sea routes, offering flexibility and access to international markets. This, combined with its low-cost production model, positions Warrior Met Coal as a key player in the global steel industry. Despite the cyclical nature of the coal market, the company’s strong margins, focus on cost efficiency, and growth potential through the Blue Creek project make it an attractive long-term investment opportunity.

conquistudor,Is Amphastar (AMPH) a good value stock?,1727278193,1fp7a6q,0,5,"I prepared this investment thesis for another website, which was a mistake. Redditors clearly deserve better than them. Hope you like it 

**DESCRIPTION**  
  
Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a vertically integrated biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing, manufacturing, and selling generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products. The company also provides insulin APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredient) used in the development of injectable finished pharmaceutical products. A key driver of Amphastar's recent performance is its acquisition of BAQSIMI®, the first and only nasally administered glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes.



**Executive Summary**

Amphastar continues to leverage its technical expertise in complex generics and proprietary products. The company announced net revenues of $644.4 million for 2023, a substantial increase from $499.0 million in 2022. Similarly, financial results for the second quarter of 2024 are similarly strong, with net revenues growing to $182.4 million, a 25% increase from the prior year. The recent acquisition of BAQSIMI® and the company’s expanding product line signal continued growth.  
  
Amphastar is well-positioned to capitalize on its diverse portfolio of over 25 commercial products, robust pipeline, and growing manufacturing capabilities. While the company's recent acquisitions, such as BAQSIMI®, and its focus on niche markets have strengthened its position in the injectable and inhalation markets, further developments and successful integration of these strategic moves will be crucial in determining its leadership in these sectors.



**Market At Large**

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals falls under the pharmaceuticals industry and can be classified as a drug manufacturer that specializes in both specialty pharmaceuticals and generic drugs.  
  
The pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow significantly, driven by an aging population, and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes. The U.S. injectable drug market was valued at $340 billion in 2023, with Amphastar targeting over $11 billion in opportunities within the space. Additionally, the U.S. inhalation market is valued at $29 billion, where Amphastar’s Primatene MIST® has captured significant market share. The injectable drug market alone is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 8% in the next decade.

Research supports the findings in annual reports. Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. In 2022, published by Parker et al. on November 1st, 2023, stated that In 2022, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. was $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs and $106.3 billion in indirect costs attributable to diabetes. For the cost categories analyzed, 1 in 4 health care dollars spent in the U.S. is related to the care of individuals diagnosed with diabetes, with 61% of these costs being directly attributable to diabetes.

Amphastar is well-positioned to capture a share of this growing market due to its focus on diabetes-related products, particularly with its acquisition of BAQSIMI®. With diabetes care accounting for such a significant portion of healthcare spending, Amphastar’s expanding presence in this space provides a substantial growth opportunity.



**Company & Business Description**

Amphastar’s diversified product line includes injectable, intranasal, and inhalation products. Its portfolio spans over 25 marketed products, including Primatene MIST®, BAQSIMI®, Glucagon for Injection, and REXTOVYTM. The company’s pipeline includes over 20 product candidates, many of which leverage Amphastar’s core strengths in drug delivery technology, particle engineering, and API manufacturing.

Amphastar’s business model includes both selling proprietary products and manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which are sold to other pharmaceutical companies.

This year say someone maxes out their Roth IRA at $7,000. Can they spend $7,200? Or does it have to be spent per year? 

I can see $7,200 triggering something negative since it’s over the $7,000 limit (if that’s someone’s max), or is it ok to spend the leftover $ from a previous year? 

If someone maxed $7k and did nothing, and maxed $7k the next year, can they spend $14k at once?

Just wondering about my leftover balance of a couple hundred from last year, thanks!",investing,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1az7agk/can_leftover_roth_ira_balance_be_used_the_next/

MarkusEF,"In my humble opinion, Generative A.I. is the most idiotic bubble I’ve seen so far.",1708631928,1axfzdz,0,1,"There was the generalized Internet bubble of the 1990s, in which any company that added a .com to its name would see its shares skyrocket. Then came the Web 2.0 / social media bubble of the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s.   
Compared to recent “new technological paradigms,” Generative A.I. seems to have the narrowest use cases, is prone to errors/hallucinations, and is not even a novel concept. Benzinga has been publishing A.I.-generated articles regarding stock price movements, analyst estimates, earnings results, etc. for years before the marketing buzzword “generative A.I.“ became mainstream. You can tell they’re A.I.-generated because they follow a cookie-cutter template and provide few novel insights. I’ve been thoroughly unimpressed with the essays generated by ChatGPT & the like; not only do they contain occasional errors (hallucinations), they’re far from the quality of papers written by competent humans. ChatGPT might be useful for below-average university students to get by, but I don’t see how its use cases are a $10 trillion+ market. For now, seemingly every Fortune 500 company has jumped on the A.I. bandwagon, as simply mentioning A.I. on investor calls automatically leads to increased valuations.

  
Big Tech is extremely skilled at selling hype & FOMO through a new buzz word every few years. I’m just wondering how long this mania might last before it deflates, as previous manias always do. I imagine first, the non-tech companies paying NVIDIA & the like billions of dollars for A.I. chips & data centers would realize the economic/profit gain from Generative A.I. is not as large as forecasted. Then eventually, it hits the tech companies selling the shovels. But this could take years to play out.

 I've been planning for it for a decade and have been investing heavily with this in mind, both in index funds and more risky individual stocks. (I'm ok with high risk, high reward as it gets me closer to this goal, and if it doesn't work, then i can always extend my timeline.)

I have two young children, which complicates it some. 

Here's where I'm looking for advice. 
Once investments have gotten to a comfortable number, like the 4% rule, or 25x yearly expenses, where's the best place to park all the capital?

Keep it in the same investments? Move to long term CDs? Bonds? A combination of it all? I've always been in the wealth accumulation phase, never in the preservation phase, so it is uncharted waters for me.

CCalleValueInvesting,"IBKR offers good value, even in a scenario with lower interest rates",1708815709,1az86v6,0,1,"Interactive Brokers is a low-cost electronic brokerage. 74.6% of the company is held by its founder Thomas Jefferffy, leaving only about 25.4% of the company as free float in the market.  
  
The company went public in 2007 being mainly a market maker for options. As the market-making business declined, IBKR pivoted toward automatic electronic brokerage, selling the market-maker part of the business. Since then, the company has steadily increased users and equity from users.  
  
Given that they’re a low-cost provider of brokerage, highly focused on technology and automatization, their net margins are really high. That’s why, if they focus on growth, it will translate into the net margins straight away.  
  
  
  
Dividend? Buybacks? Nah  
  
  
  
The company has stated in its earnings call for Q4 2023 that increasing dividends or buying back shares are unlikely to happen. They are accumulating earnings to grow, most likely through an acquisition.  
  
The company is relentlessly focused on growth. As they don’t think that paying more dividends or buying back shares will increase the growth of the company in the long run, they will not do it. Instead, they’re scrutinizing the market to acquire a competitor. That would mean instant growth both in revenues and net margin. However, we’ve widely seen how acquisitions all over the world, and in all industries, usually destroy value. Of course, it all depends on the discipline and patience of the management team to not rush on a deal because they have the money in their hands.  
  
The future is uncertain, though. And although I’m sure that acquiring a competitor may excite the market, it may not be the best way to go. Anyway, they operate in a great industry, with good margins. So maybe declining interest rates give them an opportunity to acquire a good business at a good price.  
  
INTRINSIC VALUE OF IBKR  
  
There is a margin of safety if we estimate that the interest rates will go down to 2%. If interest rates stay higher for longer, the margin of safety is wide.  
  
Assuming the above, the normalized net profit for the company would be sitting at $1.812M. This would mean a total market value of $49.249M, or said otherwise, a 15.68% margin of safety compared to today’s price (February 16th, 2024). For this company, given its quality, growth, and earnings visibility, I have found fair a PE ratio of 27.18 times. The required margin of safety for this company would be 12.54%, which makes IBKR a buy today. Please refer to the PE calculation at the end of the document for further details.  
  
Note about the interest rates and the normalized net profit. The company stated in the Q4 2023 conference call that every 25 basis points decrease in the benchmark would result in a $56M reduction in net income. Thus, this would mean a reduction of $784M, in line with our normalized net profit.  
  
However, the company has stated that they will be pursuing an acquisition. I haven’t accounted for the excess cash as part of the base (normalized) valuation since the management is not giving it back to shareholders. But they will be pursuing an acquisition. Assuming that they won’t allocate all their excess cash to this acquisition (they have stated that they will pursue a payment based on cash and stocks), I think that a probable scenario would be a $7B acquisition. Assuming a poor return on the acquisition of 5% net profit, that would add $350M in net profits to the company. Assuming the same PE as before, the margin of safety would increase to 38.03%. All of this, assuming lower interest rates.  
  
I consider the current M.O.S. compelling enough to invest in the company. There’s plenty of upside while the downside of the investment looks reduced. Of course, this doesn’t mean that the share price won’t fall, especially if interest rates start declining, but it won’t be a decrease in value. Rather, it would represent an outstanding investment opportunity. However,",investing,0.35,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1az86v6/ibkr_offers_good_value_even_in_a_scenario_with/

cazort2,What are ways you have invested in your home that have yielded the highest annual ROI?,1708816580,1az8jex,0,217,"Here are the big ones for me:

* Replacing our electric resistance hot water heater with a heat pump one. This saved us about $500/year on our electric bill. It cost just under $3,000 after rebates, but less if you also consider a second rebate we got by bundling it with later air-sealing of our home, and a tax rebate. Even without the additional rebates the ROI is 16.7% which is insanely high.
* Air-sealing our home. This cost us $1675 after rebates and reduced our heating bill by about $1000 annually leading an absolutely insane ROI of nearly 60%. This not only saved a lot, but it hugely increased comfort; the house is less drafty. The ROI was so high, I'm considering hiring the same company back to further improve on their job in the coming year. I figure even if I get a lower ROI if it's still higher than 8% or so I will keep wanting to spend more.
* All energy-efficient lighting. This was one of the first things I installed in the home. Absolute value of savings were probably pretty low (~$150-ish) but the ROI was probably close to 100% because that was about as much as I spent on the lights.
* Installing a better showerhead which was both lower-flow but had better ergonomics and features. Improved quality of life but also saved water, which reduced both water and electric bills. My best estimate of savings were about $50 a year, and it only cost $70 so ROI is 71%. Small item and small absolute value of savings but absolutely massive ROI. Thinking of replacing other fixtures such as the kitchen and bathroom sink faucets, considering toilets too, but not sure if these will be favorable because installation costs may make them less favorable in terms of ROI.

The best thing about all of these modifications is that they also increased the value of our home, so they provide an extra increase in equity, which we can benefit from if we sell or refinance, but the ROI was so high it was worth doing even without this.

I think we may have already gotten most of the ""low hanging fruit"" and I doubt I'm going to be able to get as high an ROI going forward, but I am looking to continue to pursue more cost-saving investments.

KlutzyLawyer3637,Help is needed: sell or rent it out?,1722626676,1eiiscu,0,1,"Hi everyone,

I own a property, and I am deciding whether to sell it or continue renting it out.

Some important information:

1. my age: 34 male, married, no kids yet, $400-600k range annual income and $2.3M total net worth. Distribution: 

* current primary residence equity in California: about $600k
* rental property in WA (my previous primary residence): about $450k
* all the rest: in 401k, Roth and individual account; mostly in VOO and big tech stocks

2. the rental property I am considering sell or rent it out

* it is **free from capital gain tax** now as I have lived in it for more than 2 years in past  5 years, and it will be 3 years after I move out in A**pril 2026**, which is the biggest reason I am considering selling now
* purchase price: \*\*$780k\*\* in 2017, current evaluation: around $960k
* Location: **Ballard (in Seattle, WA)**
* Equity if I sell: $450k, after all the commission fees, repairs I can probably get **$370k**
* Interest rate: **2.5% and 30 year fix**

3. I've already rent it out for one year, here is a summary

* I am **not in Seattle anymore** so I have to let property management to manage it. I have a busy work to manage by myself.
* Monthly rent in last year: $3850, if I continue to rent: $4000, monthly payment(including principal, interest, insurance etc): $3050, so net income is $700.
* However, I actually got about almost **0 cach flow (about -$200 in a whole year) due to management fee (6%) and all small repairs. For example, a broken countertop microwave costed $400+ for the company to replace** during Christmas. 
* in past year, the **principal pay down was $13440**

So total return: 

The house price appreciation was about **3% ($780k bought price --> $960k current price)**, which is not great in great seattle area, although not bad.

If I only count that on top of the equity, it was about **9% ($200k down payment --> 370k equity)**.

Principal pay down: **$13440/$370k = 3.63%** 

Rental income**: almost $0**, next year should be slightly better

  
4. Options I am considering:

* rent it out for one more year and take one year to decide. If I sell next August, I still have the chance to have the 5 year tax free benefit
   * not sure how easy it is to stop renew in Seattle if the tenant wants to renew next year
* sell now
* keep renting it out for long-term

NunoMoto123,What determines the inherent value of a stock?,1722627506,1eij4hn,0,1,"
Correct me if I'm wrong!

I understand that a stock is an investment into a company, so you own a small part of the company and can get a part of the profits (dividends) and sometimes make decisions for the company.

The price of a stock is determined purely by supply and demand, the displayed price is actually the price at which the latest stock was sold. So it depends entirely on how much people are willing to buy/sell the stock for.

This is where I get confused. What gives a stock its value? Isn't it purely an instrument to buy and sell (for profit) then? What distinguishes a X stock from a Y stock for example? Why do people want to sell the stock (for less) when the company is doing badly, if the price is not determined by said company? For example if X was doing insanely bad, but people still wanted to buy the stock thus making the price rise even more, why would that be 'wrong'?

Since Harris stepped in and accumulated positive momentum, it fell. It’s at $28.95 as I type.

I'm looking for a gut-check/feedback on this allocation breakdown please. I use Fidelity, but considering investing in the Vanguard ETFs instead of the Fidelity MFs considering the expense ratio difference is trivial and I'd prefer ETFs in the taxable account. Here are my target allocations:

- 40% SP500 (FXAIX/VOO),
- 35% Total market (FZROX/VTI/VTSAX) to add a fraction of small/mid caps,
- 10% Large cap growth (FSPGX/VIGAX) for some high risk/reward,
- 10% Bonds (FXNAX/BND) for some safe growth,
- 5% International (FZILX/VXUS)

We found the house we like that is selling for $700k and has privacy backyard and twice more sqft with extra bedroom which will be a great house to raise a family. The house is fully remodeled so we don't need to repair anything. Monthly with everything(No HOA and 20% downpayment) will be $4,000.

I’m assuming that this is possible through crowd funding platforms. 

What do you think of the premise that private markets are the way to go. I think private market risk adjusted returns will be way worse than public markets. 

Secondly, when researching I have found several apps that are offering private deals especially in real estate. There are just too many. Is there a place for them in one’s portfolio? I was thinking of putting $15K in these platforms. I can afford to lose some of that money.

Candid-Persimmon-612,"22nd Century Group, Inc. ($XXII): Innovating in the Tobacco Industry
",1727281775,1fp8px1,0,1,"**22nd Century Group, Inc.** continues to make strides in the tobacco industry, reaffirming its commitment to providing smokers with alternatives to traditional nicotine products. Recently, the company announced a new agreement with an existing customer to supply **filtered cigar products**, enhancing its product lineup.

# New Agreement for Filtered Cigars

As part of this partnership, 22nd Century will take over the production of the customer’s filtered cigar products using an **in-house predicate blend**. The initial shipments are slated for the **fourth quarter of 2024**, with expectations to reach **200,000 cartons** or more annually. This expansion into the filtered cigar market aligns with the company’s broader strategy of diversifying its product offerings.

# Strengthening Existing Relationships

Earlier this year, 22nd Century also entered into an agreement with the same customer for its **export conventional cigarette** products. This prior deal is projected to contribute an additional **20%** to the company’s overall contract manufacturing (CMO) volumes. Production from this contract is ramping up steadily and is expected to significantly increase throughout **2025**.

# CEO Insights and Future Goals

**Larry Firestone**, Chairman and CEO, emphasized that the combination of the new filtered cigar agreement and the existing cigarette contract is expected to substantially boost production volumes. He noted that this expansion would enhance the company’s manufacturing capacity and profitability. Furthermore, the high-volume export contracts are seen as a **capital-efficient** strategy that will improve cash flow as the company aims for **cash-positive operations** by the **first quarter of 2025**.

# Conclusion

With these recent developments, **22nd Century Group** is not only broadening its product range but also strengthening its operational efficiencies. The strategic focus on meeting the needs of smokers while promoting reduced-risk products positions the company favorably in an evolving market. As production ramps up and new agreements take effect, XXII is set for significant growth in the coming years.",ValueInvesting,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fp8px1/22nd_century_group_inc_xxii_innovating_in_the/

I am not here to provide a detailed valuation breakdown.  

There are plenty of credible valuations out there that can do a far better job than me.  

I assess it’s fair value at around $130 based on my own research.  Fair valuations range from $55 to $180.  Which shows the limited use of set valuation formulas.  They require assumptions.  Assumptions you should make yourself after researching the company.  

I am posting this as an opportunity for people who were not aware of PayPal.  

As a quick recap; 
- New CEO and management team.  They are proving to be extremely effective at making PayPal into a profitable growth company once again. 
- Buybacks at a low valuation.  An excellent use of capital and at this stage, much more effective than a dividend.  
- Multiple new revenue streams opening up which are currently unrealised.  (Fast lane, Advertising)

MysteriousGoal7972,HELP! ADVICE FOR 21 y/o LOOKING TO INVEST,1727290016,1fpc199,0,1,"I'm 21 this year, currently serving mandatory military service in my country for 2 years. I am however at home 70% of the time as I do not work in the field, therefore had a lot of time to think about my future. I started learning day trading, as well as looking into investing my money. 

I put a huge chunk of my savings into mid-large cap cryptos (DCA over a course of a few months), but crypto has been extremely volatile and I figured I also wish to start investing in a less volatile environment where I can just let my money sit in the account for a few years without having to withdraw

  
The common consensus that people usually suggest (from what I have read so far) is either  ""VOO/ VT/ VTI +VXUS"" and chill, and I did some research, read some articles and found it that they have provided consistent returns almost every year.

  
Many people suggest VTI+VXUS for diversification purposes, but VOO has been outperforming VT/VTI+VXUS almost every year, and with China's reclining economy, and US still being the powerhouse of the world, I don't see why people continuously suggest VTI+VXUS over VOO even when VOO has consistently provided greater returns 

  
So having my mind made up about investing in VOO monthly, I have also decided to invest in NVDA as well with a 80/20 split with VOO. I know there is massive overlap here but I believe with how advanced tech is now, NVDA will continue to go higher in the future, I don't see many companies that can actually outperform them.

  
It may seem risky, but granted that I am only 21 this year, staying home 70-80% of the time until Oct 2025 where my service ends, and I get paid $780/month, I believe that I can afford to take on some risks as I would have the time to earn it back if I do indeed lose money, but even if I do lose, I don't believe I would lose a substantial amount unless 2008 happens again.

  
I just started really investing in both crypto and stocks this year. My plan is to DCA $800 monthly into VOO & NVDA at 80/20 split, and another $200 into crypto (will only buy at dips), this obviously isn't sustainable long term as my expense per month exceeds my monthly income, but I do have a few thousand in my bank to fall back on, and my hopes are that I would have enough profits by then to slowly pull out my initials, then rinse & repeat

  
I am extremely open to everyone's opinions here, please let me know your thoughts! I can already anticipate some negative comments haha

  
TLDR ; 1) Investing $800/month into VOO & NVDA at 80/20 split, and another $200 into crypto during dips, as a 21 y/o earning $780/month from mandatory military service, but I am home 70-80% of the time, therefore very low expenses per month.

I put a huge chunk of my savings into mid-large cap cryptos (DCA over a course of a few months), but crypto has been extremely volatile and I figured I also wish to start investing in a less volatile environment where I can just let my money sit in the account for a few years without having to withdraw

  
The common consensus that people usually suggest (from what I have read so far) is either  ""VOO/ VT/ VTI +VXUS"" and chill, and I did some research, read some articles and found it that they have provided consistent returns almost every year.

  
Many people suggest VTI+VXUS for diversification purposes, but VOO has been outperforming VT/VTI+VXUS almost every year, and with China's reclining economy, and US still being the powerhouse of the world, I don't see why people continuously suggest VTI+VXUS over VOO even when VOO has consistently provided greater returns 

  
So having my mind made up about investing in VOO monthly, I have also decided to invest in NVDA as well with a 80/20 split with VOO.

It is also a very signifcant discount to a public competitor named Bristow (VTOL).

I believe the price of PHI Group could trade \~40% higher upon an IPO because it trades at a significant discount on a price to sales basis of VTOL, is more profitable than VTOL and seems higher quality.

Candid-Persimmon-612,"22nd Century Group, Inc. Pioneering a New Era in Tobacco Products
",1727291903,1fpcsc1,0,1,"In the evolving landscape of the tobacco industry, 22nd Century Group, Inc. ($XXII) stands out as a trailblazer with its innovative approach to smoking alternatives. The company is making waves with its flagship product, VLN® cigarettes, which have garnered attention for being the world’s first and only combustible cigarettes to receive a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This significant achievement positions 22nd Century as a potential leader in a market increasingly focused on reduced harm and safer smoking options.



VLN® Cigarettes: A Game Changer

VLN® cigarettes are engineered to contain significantly lower levels of nicotine, designed for adult smokers who are looking to reduce their nicotine consumption or quit smoking altogether. With a nicotine content that is up to 95% less than traditional cigarettes, VLN® serves as a novel alternative that aligns with public health goals of reducing tobacco-related harm. The MRTP designation signifies that the FDA recognizes VLN® as a product that can potentially benefit the public health by reducing the risk of addiction and promoting a safer smoking experience.



A Mission with Purpose

The company's mission encapsulates its forward-thinking ethos: ""Our mission is to sell the last cigarette before the 22nd Century."" This tagline not only reflects the company's innovative spirit but also highlights its commitment to transitioning smokers towards reduced-risk products. By focusing on harm reduction, 22nd Century is aligning itself with the growing global shift towards more responsible tobacco use, which could resonate well with investors looking for companies with a sustainable vision.



Investment Potential

The investment landscape for 22nd Century Group is compelling, particularly given the current oversold price levels of XXII shares. The company operates in a niche market with a clear path to growth, especially as regulatory frameworks around tobacco products become increasingly focused on harm reduction. Investors may find value in the following aspects:



First-Mover Advantage: With its MRTP designation, 22nd Century is at the forefront of the reduced-risk tobacco product market, which could lead to increased market share as more consumers seek healthier alternatives.

Growth Potential: The global tobacco market is undergoing significant changes. As public awareness around the health risks of smoking continues to rise, there is a growing demand for safer products. 22nd Century’s unique positioning may allow it to capture a substantial share of this emerging market.

Supportive Regulatory Environment: The FDA’s approval of VLN® underscores a regulatory trend that favors innovation in harm reduction. This could pave the way for more favorable regulations and support for similar products in the future, enhancing growth prospects for 22nd Century.

Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations: The company is actively seeking partnerships to expand distribution channels and enhance product visibility, which can accelerate revenue growth and brand recognition.

Strong R&D Pipeline: With a robust research and development focus, 22nd Century is well-equipped to innovate further, potentially introducing new products that meet the evolving needs of consumers.



Conclusion

22nd Century Group, Inc. is positioned as a leader in the next generation of tobacco products with its revolutionary VLN® cigarettes. The FDA's recognition of these cigarettes as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product is a testament to the company's commitment to reducing smoking-related harm. For investors, the current oversold price levels present a promising entry point into a company with a visionary approach and a clear mission. As the tobacco industry continues to evolve, 22nd Century is set to play a pivotal role in shaping its future, making it an intriguing consideration for those looking to invest in a forward-looking company in the health-consc",ValueInvesting,0.13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fpcsc1/22nd_century_group_inc_pioneering_a_new_era_in/

VectorSpaceModel,"IMPP- Heads, I double my money; tails I quadruple my money",1726455209,1fhuh53,0,15,"# Business Overview

Imperial Petroleum (NASDAQ: IMPP/IMPPP) is a ship-owning company providing petroleum products, crude oil and dry bulk seaborne transportation services. It is incorporated in the Marshall Islands but operates from Athens, Greece.

The Company is controlled by Harry Vafais, a member of the Vafais family and Vafais Group, a shipping giant which controls some of the largest shipping operations in Greece. Imperial Petroleum became a spin-off from StealthGas when Harry Vafais bought tankers from his father’s company, Brave Maritime. Harry Vafais, the 46 year-old CEO of IMPP, is also the CEO for StealthGas and board member of C3is. C3is is a spin-off from IMPP. Harry Vafais also founded Stealth Maritime in 1999, which is the fleet manager of Imperial Petroleum.

# The Opportunity

**The Company is valued at $141.32 million despite having 0 debt, $190 million dollars in cash, and 10 very profitable vessels. The company is valued at 2.5 P/E. There's also a 10% short interest in the company, with 9 days to close, which could lend itself to a short squeeze.**

It gets better. The CEO was not aligned with the shareholders in the beginning, issuing shares to fund the purchase of vessels. In the last year, the CEO has bought over 50% of the shares- partially through his shell company Flawless Management Inc.

|Arethusa Properties Ltd.|-|-|-|-|38.4%|0|

As obnoxious as the shell company’s name is, it keeps getting better. The company has announced share buybacks and dividends for its preferred shares (IMPPP).

**The Company seems undervalued for 3 primary reasons:**

1. Its history of issuing shares in huge quantities.
2. The CEO’s historical lack of alignment with the shareholders.
3. Its incestuous relationship with other companies of the Varafais Group.

# Operations

Imperial Petroleum’s fleet consists of:

* 6 MR refined petroleum product tankers that carry refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, fuel oil and jet fuel, as well as edible oils and chemicals
* 2 suezmax tankers that carry crude oil
* 3 handisize drybulk carriers that transport major bulks such as iron ore, coal and grains, and minor bulks such as bauxite, phosphate and fertilizers.

Over time, the Company has diversified away from gas and petroleum, starting to carry iron, coal, grains, and minor bulks like bauxite, phosphate, and fertilizers.

The company operates in three modes:

* **Time charters:** A contract for the use of a vessel for a specific period of time and a specified daily charter hire rate, which is generally payable in advance. Operating costs incurred for running the vessel such as crew costs, vessel insurance, repairs and maintenance and lubricants are paid for by the Company under time charter agreements. A time charter generally provides typical warranties and owner protective restrictions. The performance obligations in a time charter are satisfied over the term of the contract beginning when the vessel is delivered to the charterer until it is redelivered back to the owner of the vessel. Some of the Company’s time charters may also contain profit sharing provisions, under which the Company can realize additional revenues in the event that spot rates are higher than the base rates in these time charters.
* **Bareboat charters:** A bareboat charter is a contract in which the vessel owner provides the vessel to the charterer for a fixed period of time at a specified daily rate, which is generally payable in advance, and the charterer gene",ValueInvesting,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fhuh53/impp_heads_i_double_my_money_tails_i_quadruple_my/
Socrateeez,Just sold my house. Ideas for 1 year investments ,1708818016,1az934u,0,1,"Hello r/investing! 

I recently sold my house in CA, and moved out of state. I plan on buying another home sometime in 2025, so wondering what to do with the around $500,000 after taxes profit I made. I have a Wealthfront savings account set up (5% apy) with most of the money - normally I’d throw this to an investor, but hoping for gain  with a 1 year timeline in the stock market is a risk it’d rather not take. I’m not fully risk averse - but last time I was buying a house I invested my down payment with a Robo investor and ended up -12% on the year, so would rather not go through that again. 

TLDR: 1 year investment length, is 5% in a high yield savings the best bet? I know there are I-bonds but don’t know enough about limits, hence me asking y’all.

Not much expenses. I don't go out. Just spend money buying games.

Should I take more out of my savings and put it in the stock market?

Should I increase my 401k contribution?

oliverf6810,Do you invest differently in Roth IRA vs regular Brokerage? ,1708634619,1axh5tt,0,3,"Hey everyone! 

So I have a regular brokerage account and a Roth IRA that I set up through Vanguard in 2019. My Roth IRA is almost exclusively VOO and VXUS by my brokerage has a mix of a lot of ETFS, from VOO to SCHG to VXUS to ACWI to VUG (a lot of overlap and just kind of random, I know). 

So, my question is if you guys invest differently in your Roth IRA vs your non-tax advantaged brokerage. I definitely want to be a bit more conservative in my Roth IRA, but I want to be a bit more risky in my brokerage. Is this sensible? What do you guys do?

daimon_tok,"I'm ready to make a prediction.
",1708825242,1azbrf7,0,1,"The bubble will pop.

We're in a very similar place to the tech bubble. Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype.

Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble. 

Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI.

Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.

Nvidia, Microsoft, and others making money hand over fist is great for them, but it is not an indicator of the actual success of AI, only the attempt at success. Can anyone say Aeron chair?

1daBread,Asset Allocation and Tax Loss Harvesting Question,1722441037,1egqlct,0,3,"I'm just looking for input on this. I am interested in creating a portfolio that can be used in tax loss harvesting. I have roughly come up with a breakdown of asset classes that I want and the funds that support it.

|CLASS|FUNDA|FUNDB|FUNDC|PERCENT|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LARGE GROWTH|VOOG|IWY|SCHG|30.00%|
|LARGE BALANCED|VOO|IWL|SCHX|10.00%|
|LARGE VALUE|VOOV|IWX|SCHV|10.00%|

|BONDS SHORT|BSV|SGOV||0.00%|
|BONDS MED|BSD|GOVT||0.00%|
|BONDS LONG|BLV|TLT||0.00%|

The idea here is that I rotate losses from a->b->c (c if necessary) on a quarterly basis (or as needed). The funds in each row are from different companies and track different indexes so I don't inure a wash sale. These losses will be used to offset my short term capital gains from trading and selling of my over allocated positions, as well as potentially $3k a year in income tax.

Questions:  
1. Does anyone else do this? How do you track it? I would like something visual, I have Quicken and I also use google sheets, but it would be great if there was something that could automate and pull to create something more like this [https://imgur.com/a/dwCKZY1](https://imgur.com/a/dwCKZY1)

2. Do you see any issues with the chosen funds?

3. Any other suggestions?

No_Check_159,Feedback on my Personal Investment Plan,1722550750,1ehtkj3,0,1,"Hey everyone, I am looking for some feedback on a personal finance plan. I recently graduated from college and am in a position to actually start saving for my future for the first time. I plan to invest $5000 initially, and budget around $1000 a month to grow my portfolio. 

I've been doing some preliminary research and have come up with this plan: 

**50%: S&P 500
20%: Real Estate Investment Trusts
20%: Exchange Traded Funds
10%: Whales (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, etc)**

I think my idea is to put my money into safer, more long term investments because I don't have the experience or time to prospect on individual holdings. 

S&P is the most consistent index, so I plan for it to take up the biggest share of my portfolio. I like that RITs have higher returns in terms of dividends than other types of holdings, and that their connection to the real estate market makes them relatively stable. I also like that I can speculate a little with ETFs but not face the same volatility of investing in individual companies.

They mentioned us several times but it was only mention about the acquisition and never really went into detail about anything. 

  
So I was wondering where, if anywhere at all, can you go to find more detailed information? Or is that type of information not usually made public?

I've been stocking up on SPDR S&P500 as that one has the lowest TER of 0.03% for investors in Europe.  
I thought I would shift my S&P500 investments from a distributing ETF to an accumulating one. I'm just reinvesting the dividends anyway so may as well save myself a (taxable) step with having it automatically re-invested.  
However, when looking on justetf it looks like the accumulating version of the fund has a slightly lower overall performance than the distributing one. How is this possible? Shouldn't the accumulating fund outperform the distributing one on account of the reinvested dividends?  
Any insight is most welcome! Here are the ISIN numbers for reference:

kumaramit0703,How I analyze stocks for the long-term: Framework walkthrough,1707988015,1arbdre,0,2,"I wrote a post a few days back on why we should *learn* to analyze individual stocks, even if you choose to invest most of your money in index funds/ETFs. You can read the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1amihwf/why_you_should_learn_to_invest_in_individual/).

In this post, I will share the process I have been using to analyze individual stocks. It requires fair bit of work and thinking, but it’s worth the effort for the clarity I get.

When we buy a stock, we are buying piece of a business. By asking a series of structured questions, I try to understand how the underlying business works, predict what it will be like in a few years, and estimate a reasonable price for buying it whole.

I don’t want to spent weeks and months doing complex analysis and financial modeling like institutional investors. My goal is to do simple evaluation of publicly traded companies by putting in reasonable effort to arrive at a conclusion that makes sense for me as an the individual investor.

Even though I only intend to buy few stocks, I think that I will be buying the whole business and keep it for many years. And to figure out if I want to purchase it, I try to answer these six questions:

1. **What does the business do?**
2. **Is it a good business?**
3. **If it’s a good business, why is it good?**
4. **Can it remain a good business in future too?**
5. **Is it run by competent and honest people?**
6. **Is it available at a fair price?**

Let’s take a hypothetical example to illustrate how this investing framework can be applied. Imagine that a popular sandwich store in our neighborhood just became available for sale. We have money in bank and are seriously considering buying it. I will try to answer these questions in order (We will skip management analysis in this example as it’s more applicable for public companies)

**1. What does this business do?** We want to figure out how does this business work and make money. There are four main things to understand:

* What does the business sell? *(sandwiches, drinks, cookies)*
* Who are the customers? *(locals vs tourists, old vs young, rich vs poor)*
* How does it sell its products and services? *(what are the channels: in-store vs online orders vs group catering)*
* What are its costs? *(ingredients, labor, rent, marketing)*

**2. Is it a good business?** Once we have a decent understanding of how the business works, we want to look at its health. More specifically,

* Does it have a clean balance sheet? *(is it loaded up with debt? And how much assets the store owns?)*
* What are the sales of the store? *(revenue from sale of food and drinks)*
* What are the profit margins like? *(gross profit and net profit)*
* How much cash does the store generates? *(operating cash and free cash flow)*
* What’s the return on invested capital? *(Am I better off just buying risk-free bonds?)*
* How have these numbers grown or declined in last few years? How does these numbers compare to industry average and other similar food joints?

**3. What makes it a good business?** So far if we think it’s a good business, we now want to understand why is it so and how it stands out from competition.

* Who are its competitors? *(local joints, larger chains, other eateries)*
* Does it have a competitive advantage or a “moat” *(hard to have moats in food industry for local stores, but few have a strong brand)*
* Why do customers keep coming back to this place? Or will they keep paying even when we raise prices?

**4. Will it continue to be a good business in future?** This is where we need to think strategically about future, especially about three aspects:

* Is the company’s moat durable? *(If the owner or chef leaves, will the business tank? What can harm the brand?)*
* What are the main risks the business face? *(What if key suppliers go out of business or increase prices? Can changing customer preferences towards healthier foods impact sales?)*
* What are the biggest opportunities? *(is t",investing,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1arbdre/how_i_analyze_stocks_for_the_longterm_framework/

AptitudeSky,Lemonade (lmnd) is today what GEICO was when Warren Buffet made his most famous investment. ,1726458954,1fhvmn1,0,1,"Here is one I don’t see in this sub even though most are Warren buffet disciples. 

Lemonade (LMND)

Lemonade is an insurance company selling home, pet, renters, and car (not sure if they sell other types). 

They have a little over 2,000,000 customers and counting  with increasing PIF. Their retention rate is increasing and their loss ratios are WELL BELOW 100%. When an insurance company has loss ratios below 100%, it means they are making money from their book of business. 

Here is the kicker, they are an AI company before AI was cool. So they sell a ton of policies and work some of their claims, through their automated systems, meaning less employee overhead then a more traditional insurance business at this scale. 

Lastly, I think they said in their most recent call they are or will consistently be cash flow positive this quarter or maybe after q4 (can’t remember so check me on that one).

>

Is it true that John Bogle said that?

Is it true that for every investor who earns above average, there is an investor who earns below average?

When considering outperforming the market, every outperformance implies an underperformance or loss elsewhere?

If the market did 10% this year and I did 20%, did I outperform someone else?

Therefore it is not possible for every investor this year to make 20% when the market did 10%?

Can we can think of the market as a cake of earnings, every year the cake's size is different according to the market performance and each investor gets a slice, when an investor gets a bigger than-average slice he takes someone else's part of the slice and when an investor takes an average size slice he therefore only takes his own slice and not someone's else?

krisolch,Jet2 is still grossly mis-priced in my opinion,1727177170,1foa4hy,0,9,"Why?

- Taking market share in the package holiday segment from TUI and other smaller providers. This will continue to happen and my project is they will go from 21% today to 33% of UK package holidays by 2035 because they offer a better product than competitors with better customer service.

- A larger % of their revenue comes from package holidays each year which is higher margin

- They have an order on for 146 new airbus planes. Hopefully no issues will come from these as they don't have the whit-pratney engine issues like Wizz air has. This is projected to cost £5bn in capex (incl. other maintenance capex) over the next 6 years.

- Package holidays market should continue to grow modestly and be equal to flight-only holiday market in 10 years.

- They earn quite a bit of interest on their customer deposits of £2bn customer cash that customers pay upfront (this will go down as rates go down)

- Jet2 do not say what their margins are on package holidays, however easyjet holidays, a competitor has an oper. margin of 10.5% from their most recent report, so conservativily I have assumed 8% margin right now for jet2 (given higher customer service) that then goes to 10.5%\~ in 10 years just for the package holiday segment.

- Peel hunt also seems to think so, although my intrinsic value is much higher than theirs still: [https://citywire.com/investment-trust-insider/news/expert-view-vistry-asos-genus-jet2-hilton-food/a2449435?page=4](https://citywire.com/investment-trust-insider/news/expert-view-vistry-asos-genus-jet2-hilton-food/a2449435?page=4)

>""Jet2 valuation ‘far too low’, says Peel Hunt  
  
The valuation of Jet2 (JET2) has been hampered by a tough trading environment but it does not reflect the fact the package holiday group is giving customers what they want, says Peel Hunt.  
  
Analyst Alexander Paterson reiterated his ‘buy’ recommendation and target price of £22 on the Citywire Elite Companies A-rated stock, which climbed 1% to £14.70 on Thursday and has soared 40% over the past year.  
  
The company has described full-year 2025 year-to-date trading as in line with management expectations.  
  
‘The shift to later booking patterns has continued, but robust booking momentum means load factors have improved since June,’ said Paterson. ‘Package holiday mix also remains much higher than pre-Covid levels.’  
  
Paterson said that Jet2 ‘continues to offer what customers want and generates superb customer satisfaction ratings’.  
  
‘This is not an easy trading environment, and we do not believe the current valuation sufficiently reflects the group’s progress,’ he said.  
  
The shares currently trade on a price to earnings of 8 times which he said was ‘far too low’.""

Absolutely no idea why they are using a PE ratio though for an airline company... pretty silly.

However I get an intrinsic value similar to peel hunt of £22 today.

Their management by CEO Steve Heapy is really good too.

Key_Type_4102,"Do you think the stock price of a ""wonderful"" business will bounce up quickly after a super dip?",1726125472,1fewno2,0,8,"Warren Buffett defines a wonderful business as one that has strong fundamentals:
- Consistant and strong cashflows
- Strong business moat so it can protect its market share
- Trustworthy management team so they would prioritize investors

So my hypothesis is, if the stock price of a wonderful business is extremely undervalued, in theory, price would bounce back up in 1-3 years of time.

For example, Meta dropped from $300 to $90 and bounce back up to $500 in a fast V-shape. The entire thing happened within 3-4 years, and reaching all time high Revenue & Earnings.

Thus, in the opposite, if a company fails to rebounce after a long-period of time, lets say 3-10 years. If it doesn't continue to grow its Revenue/Earnings, obviously it's not a good business.

But even if it has grown them at a good rate, if stock price fails to reflect the growth due to whatever reasons after a long time, this means that business isn't a good one? Reasons can be:
- The company is not as undervalued as you think
- Country-risk or regulatory-risk
- Management isn't returning value to shareholder

I would like to know your thoughts on my hypothesis. Correct me if I'm wrong, thanks a lot :)

HouseofVladingus,Bluelinx (BXC): A construction supplier with insane cash reserves,1726127990,1fex7fk,0,5,"Bluelinx is a construction supplier with a market cap of $800 million and has on its balance sheet $500 million in cash, the fruit of an excellent 2021 and 2022 (seriously; the company had a P/E ratio of 3 both of those years) that the company hasn't quite figured out what to do with, apart from paying down their revolving line of credit and some desultory share repurchases. Naturally the company is cyclical and exposed to the housing construction market which is in a slump lately, but the company has a credit facility of $345 million that is currently unused and still has positive operating cash flow, so most or all of that cash reserve is theoretically distributable. By way of illustration, the company began 2021 with the princely sum of $82 *thousand* in cash.

Even in these difficult times, of the remaining $310 million in market cap the company is on course to produce $50 million in free cash flow.

Constant_Air1532,The Children's Place ($PLCE) 55%+ SHORT INTEREST,1726486591,1fi2b99,0,1,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share some insights into **The Children's Place ($PLCE)**, a children’s apparel retailer that I've been covering for almost a year. It's a heavily shorted stock with pretty decent financials that recently got taken over (management and board) by a massive Saudi activist group.

The Children’s Place ($PLCE) is one of the biggest names in kids’ apparel, focusing on everything from clothing to footwear for newborns to preteens. What sets them apart is their heavy reliance on private-label products, which allows them to keep costs in check while maintaining control over their brand. In recent years, they've made a big pivot towards e-commerce, scaling back on underperforming physical stores and doubling down on online sales.

This shift was accelerated during the pandemic, and while stores have reopened, the real growth story for PLCE lies in its digital strategy. Their partnership with Amazon and Walmart to extend their reach online has also been a smart move to tap into broader customer bases.

Financially, The Children’s Place has navigated some rough waters, from inflation pressures to supply chain challenges, but they’ve done a solid job staying competitive. IMO, their key strength is pricing. PLCE consistently offers deep discounts and promotions, which keeps customers coming back. Even with these discounts, they’ve managed to improve their margins by becoming more operationally efficient and focusing on keeping inventory lean.

Another area they've been watching closely is their debt. While they’ve had to manage it carefully, the balance sheet is looking more stable, which gives investors a bit more confidence. If they can continue trimming costs and boosting online sales, there’s definitely potential for financial improvement.

That said, PLCE isn’t without risks. Supply chain issues are a constant headache, and with inflation squeezing consumers, parents might start spending less on kids’ clothes. They also face tough competition from brands like Carter's and big players like Target and Walmart, which offer more variety. But there are opportunities too. Their omni-channel approach - balancing physical stores with an aggressive online push - seems to be paying off. Plus, with most of their products being private-label, they have room to play with pricing and maintain healthy margins.

If they can keep capitalizing on e-commerce growth and maybe even explore more international markets, there’s a lot of upside potential here.

Spare_Firefighter974,Introducing My New Stock Backtesting Tool,1708635644,1axhlav,0,2,"Hey everyone, I've been working on a project that might interest fellow investors here. It's a tool designed to assist in creating and evaluating stock investment strategies. Here’s a quick overview:

* Access fundamental data for over 5,000 companies spanning from 2009 to 2023.
* Utilize 18 different metrics to gauge portfolio performance.
* Compare your strategy outcomes against the S&P 500 to see how you stack up.

Given that it's still in the beta phase, I anticipate there could be a few glitches here and there, and I'd advise against using it as the sole basis for your investment decisions at this point.

  
I’m eager to hear your thoughts on this tool. Any ideas for additional features or improvements are greatly welcomed. Your constructive feedback is much appreciated!

Munk45,401k reallocation at market peaks,1708710561,1ay6u5t,0,1,"Hello.

My 401k is underperforming the general market because of my current allocation:

43% large cap growth index
43% large cap value index
13% small cap index

Generally I'm looking to be 100% in index funds and match the annual performance of a major index like S&P or NASDAQ. 

So the 56% of my portfolio in value and small cap is dragging my overall performance as compared to S&P and NASDAQ.

I'm going to reallocate but since S&P and NASDAQ are at all time highs, I don't think it's a good time to move large chunks of money in.

I've changed my future contributions to buy 100% large cap growth. I'm comfortable with a DCA approach on my contributions.

I'm considering just holding my current assets until there is a dip in the large cap growth or a big spike in the value.

What's your approach with reallocation at our current ATHs?

$24k Traditional IRA (from TSP)

$0 Roth IRA

$5k - Stocks 

Which fidelity funds should I put my TSP in?

Should I let it this amount sit and no longer contribute to it? Or should I continue to contribute to it?

A part of me wants to convert it into a Roth IRA?

jxx17_,Roll overs and self management,1708827221,1azcfte,0,4,"Okay there's a few different things in here so I'll try my best to lay it all out.

Current situation:

\- 5% of my income goes in a trad 401k for the company match

\-  I use a trad IRA to backdoor in a Roth IRA every year

\- I invest some extra in a taxable account

&#x200B;

First question is that I want to roll over my 401k every 2 months and self manage in my trad IRA. I do not plan to backdoor these contributions because it's going to increase my tax burden and I'd rather defer some taxation for now. By doing this, does it impact my annual contribution to the trad IRA that I then roll over to a Roth? I'm not sure how the pro rata rule factors in here if at all.

My second question, is I have the option to also participate in a Roth 401k. For this scenario I'm assuming my entire match is for the trad contribution, so I could just roll over some extra capital into my Roth IRA every month. However if I decide I want the Roth contributions matched and I roll over, what tax consequences could I be looking at? If I ever wanted to withdraw the 'contributions' from the Roth IRA are matches considered gains or contributions?

Basically I want to self manage my 401k by rolling it into my IRAs and want to figure out the most efficient and least tax consequential method of doing so. I want to add a Roth 401k contribution to roll over and not sure which one to add the company match on.

PostPostMinimalist,I Bonds as the best safe asset for tax purposes?,1708830831,1azdmrw,0,3,"While most of my portfolio is in VT, having some portion in a safe inflation protected asset is appealing. I'm thinking I Bonds might be the best way to go (simply buy the max every year, forever).  
  
My understanding is that in general people are lukewarm on I Bonds because TIPS or HYSA or money market funds can provide higher returns and be more flexible. However, I'm not so sure this is true for my circumstance for a few reasons.  
  
(1) I Bonds are state/local tax free. I have an over 10% state + local tax rate now, so this is meaningful. Some other assets also have this property, but I don't right now know of any others which also have....  
  
(2) You can defer paying tax until redeeming. Right now my marginal tax rate is near 50%. So I make 5% on a HYSA and lose half of it. But in theory if I just hold the I Bonds until retirement (where my income will certainly be way way lower) then I will pay significantly less tax on the interest then I would along the way via HYSA/tips/money market etc.  
  
So my questions are: Does anything else also have the combo property of (1) and (2)? Or even just (2)...  
  
And is this actually likely to be worth the difference in returns compared to other safe options? Understood if it's sort of impossible to know but would appreciate some input.

    Lyft also said it sees first-quarter bookings of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, beating StreetAccount estimates of $3.46 billion.

    The stock lost much of its gains after the CFO said the earnings release had a major error. 

     Lyft Chief Financial Officer Erin Brewer said on the earnings call that the company had misstated its margin expansion in the press release. Rather than 500 basis points, or 5%, of growth for 2024, as the company initially indicated, the actual increase will be 50 basis points, or 0.5%, Brewer said.

Milati,My first ~5 years as an investor,1707996078,1ard9q5,0,1,"Hello everyone,

A few years ago, I wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/cnjhgt/23yo_started_working_full_time_looking_to_start/) about the beginning of my investing journey and [another one](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/k02lkl/my_first_year_as_an_investor/) after my first year as an investor. Currently, I am 27 years old and have been investing for about five years. This is an update on my current situation: I worked as an IT/Business consultant for my first employer for three years, and now I am a data analyst consultant at a new job. My current salary looks like this:

* \~€2650 net
* \~€160 meal vouchers
* Company car & fuel card
* Pension savings ('Group insurance') to which \~€130 is added each month
* The 'usual' (insurance, holiday pay, 13th month, ...)

&#x200B;

Since the last posts, my investment portfolio changed quite a lot. The total amount at the time of writing is hovering around **€149.000**:

* ETFs: Invested €33.000, now it is worth €44.000+
* Cryptocurrencies: Invested €5000, now it is worth €45.000
* Cash: €10.000
* Retirement funds: €4.000+
* Personal Companies: \~€35.000
   * Used €30.000 to start a small **real estate company** with 2 friends. We've done 2 projects since (flipping 2 apartments) but I'm still waiting on the final year overview from the accountant to update the €30.000 to the actual value right now.
   * The other €5.000 was invested in a business I recently took over together with my girlfriend. This business is a **fry shop** (called 'frituur' in Dutch) which is now running for a little over a month. Of course, we took a loan from the bank as well. It is still too early to update the value of this company.
* Real Estate: \~€30.000 in equity. This is the building that we bought together with the 'frituur' business mentioned above. We are in the process of renovating the apartment on the first floor so we can actually live there as well in a couple of months.
* A personal loan from my parents - €20.000. I took this out the finance the real estate that we bought. In this way, I didn't have to sell any investments.

&#x200B;

I guess if you have been following this stock you know the parabolic explosion in the price.  

My question is about Trailing stop losses. 

My usual rule of thumb is that I set a stop loss at 7%, but the volatility in this stock is crazy and this thing can swing 7% in a matter of hours.    
I am wondering what others do with trailing stop losses with such volitility?    


I don't want to get stop out too quickly on a short term market movement and have to pay my taxes on my CG, but I do want to protect my profits.

It seems like the recessions we had like in 2008 and in the 1900s were global spanning over entire countries and verious industries at once.  
 
It looks like the recessions we are having today will be more and more sectorial/industrial than global.  
What i mean by that is that if a sector or industry is having a layoffs, drop in sales or a recession than it would impact mostly that industry while other industries will keep on their same trajectory.   
It seems that the markets found ways to adapt to a lot of different scenarios and find ways to work around problems (ex: WFH during COVID-19) so they can still keep functioning.

I’m starting my own business, and once income allows for it I’m trying to figure out what my best options are. My current understanding is that the maximum contribution to a 401k is 69k. So I can contribute 23k and the business could contribute the other 46k. I keep hearing about mega backdoor Roth options, so I’m curious if it would be more advantageous to go that route and not have the company contribute to the 401k. What do you guys think would be best? I like the idea of the money going into a Roth so it’s tax free at withdrawal, but the immediate tax benefits for the business are nice too.",investing,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1atcyzl/company_contribution_vs_mega_backdoor_roth/

Physical_Owl8521,"Maxed out my Roth IRA, now what?",1707868699,1aq8ovi,0,2,"Background: I’m in my early 20s and live rent free with my parents. I have an emergency fund of 10k if something goes wrong. I have 0 debt, no loans and credit cards have a 0 balance. High 700’s credit score. I have maxed my IRA 3 years in a row including this year. It’s mostly in a s&p index with a smaller portion of it in an international index  fund. I am not eligible for a 401k this year at my job but will be able to next year and will take advantage of the match. With the extra money I have outside of those things, and future expected income, where should I invest next? 
I opened a brokerage account where I was going to put my money in mostly VOO (80%), reputable tech stocks like Microsoft, apple, google, or a tech index(10%), (5%) in well known crypto like BTC and ETH, and the remaining (5%) in speculative assets that I have faith in.  

That being said I do want to move out of my parents house in my 20s, and I don’t want to rent an apartment. So eventually within the next 4-5 years I want to own a house somewhere. 

Does it make sense to hold my earnings in a brokerage account like that and maybe eventually pull from there for a property down payment?

Also I’m not making ton of money, maybe ~40k after taxes this year.

MereMortal123,"Fastned BV (FAST.AS): Not the European 'Plug Power', but a super decent value investment ",1726819498,1fl6v67,0,10,"**Company overview**  
Fastned is a European EV fast-charging provider with a very clear focus: only offer ultra fast charging at very high traffic locations. They do not compromise in charging speed, very high traffic location or quality of charging (they always have locations covered from the rain, adaptability is guaranteed, practically no downtime).

They have been leading in the Dutch market for over 10 years now and are currently active throughout Europe.

**Key take-aways**

* They only have one real competitor: Ionity. Other competition may be Tesla (for now they only focus on off-highway charging) and fossil fuel companies (mainly Total Energies and Shell; but they are miles behind in terms of speed, location size and quality).
* They already have 318 sites operational generating ever increasing revenues and another 191 locations secured. Fastned will probably beat it's own goal of 1000 locations by 2030.
* They have a really strong balance sheet with enough cash to keep developing new stations untill the end of 2026
* Very high insider ownership: only 25% of the shares are free float, the rest is owned by long-term committed investors and insiders

**Financials**

* Revenue growth in H1 2024 was +45% compared to H1 2023, beating their own expectations.
* Projected revenues for all of 2024 are €80m (€4 per share)
* On track to realizing €1000m revenues (roughly €50 per share) with operational EBITDA of 40%/€400m in 2030 (€20 per share)

They have never made net profit, because they are still investing in new locations. One location can cost up to €1m depending on how many chargers, planning permission cost, etc.

They've had a positive operational EBITDA for years and this year is the first year that their expansion costs are actually covered by their cash flow, which means the actual EBITDA is positive in 2024. It is expected to be around €3m! This means that they won't have to increase their credit facilities.

They have about €10m per year in financing costs and €3m in depreciation. Their net loss is indeed €10m a year. Depending on their investment strategies they will actually make a net profit in 2025 or 2026.

Maybe it's good to add: they have built a really strong brand in The Netherlands and their PR is quite strong. Their CEO is very good at telling the story and getting investors on board. Because of their strong public profile, they've been able to collect €180m in retail bonds in multiple rounds at 5,5% and 6% at a time interest rates for growth smallcaps were usually a lot higher!

I would definitely recommend their IR page. Check out their latest slide deck: [Investor Presentation - New (September 2024) (fastnedcharging.com)](https://www.fastnedcharging.com/media/2clptk20/investor-presentation-new-september-2024.pdf) or follow their CEO on LinkedIn (he's pretty active): [Michiel Langezaal | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michiellangezaal/recent-activity/all/)

**Outlook**  
Although the transition to EV mobility is not going as quickly as previously expected, there's still very strong momentum. Thus far Fastned has been very realistic, even conservative in it's own outlook. They have historically always met their own expectations, usually beating it slightly.

Revenues will keep on growing in the coming years because of:

* More EVs on the road. Although the growth in EV sales halted somewhat in 2024, EV sales will start growing up as new EU regulations hit.
* New Fastned locations. As said: Fastned has become really good at winning tenders, finding highway locations and developing these. Plus they have the money to do so!
* People using fast charging more often: currently EVs are usually owned by relatively wealthy people with their own driveway + charger. They charge at night at home. EVs are becoming more affordable and people that live in appartments or smaller houses without a driveway will use public charging locations more often, resulting in a higher percentage of EV charging sessions at ",ValueInvesting,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fl6v67/fastned_bv_fastas_not_the_european_plug_power_but/

Earnings growth in **Nvidia (NVDA)** and other artificial intelligence (AI) companies have proven that data center growth will soar. Power consumption from these energy-sucking fortresses is expected to result in a double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of \~10% until 2030.

**2. Nuclear Funding Secured**

Banking juggernauts, including **Bank of America (**BAC**),** **Citi (**C**),** and **Morgan Stanley (**MS**)** pledged on Monday to support the goal of tripling nuclear power.

**3. Growing Political Support**

Earlier this week, **Constellation Energy (**CEG**)** signed a 20-year mega-deal with **Microsoft (**MSFT**)** to provide nuclear power for its data centers. While most Republicans have been pro-nuclear, Democrats have been more hesitant to support it due to environmental concerns. However, Josh Shapiro, one of the most popular Democratic politicians, and the governor of the swing state of Pennsylvania, said the deal should be “fast-tracked.”

**4. Electric Grid Issues**

From Georgia to Arizona to Texas, utility companies are struggling to keep up with soaring electricity demand – and that’s before the AI buildout. Nuclear is the only way the U.S. power grid can catch up to where it needs to be.

**5. Nuclear Energy is Clean Energy (OP NOTE : NOT EXACTLY)**

Nuclear energy does not impact air quality, has a small footprint, and produces very little waste.

bawera23,¿What are your competitive advantages as an investor?,1727187225,1fodii1,0,8,"Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet, George Soros, Bill Ackman, and Ben Graham, what do they have in common? They all leveraged their unique competitive advantages as investors to achieve outstanding returns in the market.

Every investor talks about the competitive advantages companies have and why those will lead to outsized returns, a company with a moat can maintain higher margins and achieve higher returns on capital for an extended timespan. But not so many people talk about the competitive advantages we have as investors, each one of us has different competitive advantage that allows us to invest in some opportunities other investors cannot, like in business having a moat and taking advantage of it can lead to higher returns. The problem is that most investors do not know that they have a moat, they do not know what makes them different and how they can achieve outsized returns taking advantage of it. This is what we are going to solve in this article, how to discover your hidden advantages and how to get the most out of them.

If you have ever been an entrepreneur and tried to offer a product or service, you know that one of the first questions you must answer about your business is: What makes me different from my competitors? why someone will choose me over them? We should apply something similar in investing, when we are trying to invest in individual companies, you should ask yourself: which companies are going to be overlooked by other investors and therefore offer a substantial discount to intrinsic value? This question is not easy to answer most of the times. This question is key to make sure that you are not falling into a value trap. After you find about the main advantages you can have as an investor you will be able to understand which ones you are taking advantage of when you are buying a cheap company and if you do not find no one you could be falling into a value trap.

If everyone thinks a company is a great investment, it will not probably provide market beating returns over the long term, it is that simple. If a stock is a no brainer for everyone it will always be fully priced in and probably even slightly over valued. To find a great investment opportunity we must think about how we can find a great investing opportunity that aligns with our interests. Everybody wants a stock that is highly liquid, stable, big market cap, profitable, a business that is going through great times, with accurate guidance and easy to understand, however every stock that is like this is fully priced in. Therefore, you should think which of these characteristics of a business are a must for you and which ones are not, once you know what highly desired characteristics are not essential for you is when you found your competitive advantage, now you are able to invest in companies that most investors might overlook.

To make it easier I have created eight categories of competitive advantages you can have as an investor. They are: time, assets under management, intelligence, market knowledge, pressure from investors, biases, liquidity needs and contacts.

lem_lel,"Clear Secure (YOU), Stock analysis. would you buy any shares of clear?",1727187510,1fodm58,0,1,"Clear Secure (YOU), Stock analysis  (i dont own any shares of clear)

  

Is a biometric security company which means it produces eye and fingerprint scanners but clear secure markets them skillfully. At airports there are extra clear booths where you can confirm your identity via scanner if you have a clear plus membership and thus skip the line for normal government identity confirmation at the airport.  

  

Clear secure benefits:  

  

Clear secure benefits from unorganized airports by offering a short queue with which you can get identified by eye scan and thus do not have to wait the normal often long waiting time.   

  

Identity checks at airports are already overloaded with queues sometimes hours long and every year more people will travel and fly so it may be worthwhile for people who travel often to buy a Clear plus membership.  

  

So far, clear scanners are only available at 60 airports in the US, so they have a long way to go to expand  

  

Even though their offer is very expensive (199 dollars per year) and only worth it for people who fly 5 times or more per year, you can get it cheaper with credit cards or other offers, for example with tsa precheck in the offer.   

  

clear secure is also partnering with tsa precheck so in the future they can also take over the check-in of tsa precheck subscribers on behalf of tsa precheck which can be a good way to market clear plus and also shows a good cooperation between clear secure and the government.  

  

For the airports, clear secure is also a win because it brings in a lot of money and with decreasing parking revenue, the airports can replace other revenue streams that are getting lower.  

  

Their scan technology can also be used in various locations such as stadiums, offices, stands, etc. they have created a kind of ecosystem with the aim that in the future you can identify yourself everywhere with your face via clear secure and confirm your data such as age identity and vaccination status. other possible locations would be healthcare, clubs casinos etc. so far clear is already active in several stadiums and interesting partnerships are perhaps those with LinkedIn at LinkedIn you can log into your account via clear secure scan for a year now. You can also register at home depot locations using clear secure. what is interesting here is the way in which the manegment is introducing clear secure in different areas, which shows how many places you can use clear scan technology  

  

clear's ceo has been ceo since 2010 and she initiated all the things that make clear the company it is today  

  

Another interesting point is that clear secure has no direct competitors in this type of business other companies that also sell biometric security services such as facial iris and fingerprint scans serve the us government for example IDEMIA and Thales Group also help with their scans at border control or help with tsa checks at the airport they sell to the government but only the technology.  

  

while clear secure pioneered a commercialized customer-facing system with purchasable premium memberships and stand-alone queues at the airport.   

  

As for the clear plus membership retention rate, last year in Q2 it was 90% and has dropped to 80% this year due to a price increase. of course i hope that this trend will not continue but i assume that in the future the retention rate will remain between 80-90%.  

  

Price increases are nothing unusual for Clear but since 2010 the price of the clear plus membership has only been increased twice while the product has grown from two extra lines to 60 extra lines. this year clear has also added a perk to the celar plus membership. there are some discounts for third party services through the membership and there is also a free search service that you can call if you realize you have forgotten or lost something at the airport and they will look it up on their own or help you find it.

Darkness297,Analyzing stocks for value investing through options,1726144871,1ff1l06,0,7,"Hi everyone. I am building a market screener (a map of all the stocks in US stock exchanges), categorised by sector and by industry for good competitive comparison.

I will be analyzing stocks and where I see long-term opportunity I will invest through options only. My strategy in options will be to 
1. Obtain shares of a stock by selling puts (thus lowering the cost basis in some cases before getting assigned).
2. Buy calls (leaps specifically) expiring 1 year or more after buying, and then sell if they are profitable and I do not see further value, or exercise and keep the shares if the stock is still of interest.

Now, for the analysis part, I am using Google Sheets to get advantage of the GoogleFinance formula and I eould like your perspective. Currently, as you can see in the screenshots (can't post them but will lay them down in the comment section), I registered the companies with their ticker symbols and
1. Industry of sector
2. Share price (green if above 52W average, red if below)
3. Market Cap
4. Volume avg
5. PE
6. EPS
7. High, low and avg of 1Y
8. Percentage of change in share price for 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 3Y and 5Y

I would like to add more to the above if there is any significant metric I missed, any feedback is wrlcome. Ofc I will be doing also a TA on stocks basically through RSI and MA crossovers.

Also, further to the above, how does one analyse 10 or 100 stocks on the same industry, what would your criteria be to examine this? Would you go sector by sector, industry by industry? I do not want to just follow the news and trends. My next step it to examine 10-K and 10-Q, but on what to emphasize? Also board members and CEOs.

TLDR; How do you value a stock both on itself and in comparison with other companies in the same industry? What criteria do you use? How do you get a full picture of the market/sector/industry?

I may be overthinking this, but I can't just go out there in the chaos of the stock market and just blindly invest based on a hunch or a trend...

TickernomicsOfficial,Is Paramount the quintessential value play?,1726507228,1fiadft,0,6,"Back in july paramount announced its acquisition deal with Skydance Media, the private equity firm of Larry Elison’s son. At first $PARA.B shares traded up 20% as the buyout price was $15 per share it has since shrunk down. Now that the shopping window has closed this deal is in the hands of the FTC. 

This FTC administration has been notoriously hard on business so there is definitely some risk of this being blocked. I guess the question is what are the odds? 

If the deal goes through we know the shares have 50% upside and if it doesn’t paramount likely goes bankrupt and only little equity will be salvaged after a long proceedings. This is kinda similar to the Activision buyout Buffet was heavily invested in but Activision had much less downside risk if it blocked.

Taken a big knock recently, as far as I can see due to implications/complications Row vs Wade has caused for some of their offerings and just announced a major client will leave end of year. This is around 13% of revenue, but apparently less in EBIDAT, so perhaps a lower margin client. (GPT told me this by, so a pinch of salt, nut everything else it said seems to  check out, so assuming it read and didn't hallucinate this).

Has no debt and around 370mil in cash. Currently doing a 100mil share buy back (around 32 mil still to be purchased)  

Has a binary bet element I think, in that I if Democrats win this company will benefit, as family planning and laws around this likely to be supported. And if republicans win I can see laws around family planning tightening and ambiguity or uneven unlawfulness around freezing eggs and IVF which will be bad for PGNY for obvious reason.

Macro trends of having families later seem to be in its favour and net profit margin seems to be moving in right direction after a dip which will make the PE attractive with even a few additional %.

Rich_Minimum_2888,"ROIC vs. ROIC Excluding Goodwill vs. ROIIC, Which Metric Should You Use?",1727191378,1fof4zi,0,2,"When evaluating a company's performance, most investors rely on common profitability metrics like **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**. John Huber has written extensively on the topic, and I highly recommend reading his work on this subject[ here](https://sabercapitalmgt.com/calculating-the-return-on-incremental-capital-investments/). As companies become more complex—especially those involved in mergers and acquisitions—it's essential to dig deeper into the data. Two variations on traditional ROIC, **ROIC excluding goodwill** and **Return on Incremental Invested Capital (ROIIC)**, offer more nuanced insights into capital efficiency and growth potential.

This article will explore these three metrics, how they differ, what they reveal about a company's performance, and how to use them effectively in your investment strategy.

# 1. ROIC: Return on Invested Capital

At its core, **ROIC** measures a company’s ability to generate profits relative to the capital invested in the business. It’s one of the most popular metrics for understanding how well a company uses its capital to generate value.

# Formula:

ROIC=Invested CapitalNet /Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT)​

**Invested capital** includes all capital used by the company in its operations, including equity, debt, and intangible assets like goodwill.

# What ROIC Tells You:

* **Efficiency**: ROIC shows how well a company is using its total capital to generate profits.
* **Comparability**: It allows investors to compare companies of different sizes in the same industry. A higher ROIC generally indicates more efficient capital use.
* **Benchmark**: If ROIC exceeds the company’s cost of capital, it creates value for shareholders. If it’s lower, the company is destroying value.

# Limitations:

* **Goodwill Inclusion**: ROIC includes goodwill, which can distort the measure of how efficiently a company’s core operating assets are being deployed. Goodwill is created during acquisitions, and since it doesn’t generate cash flows directly, it can weigh down ROIC.

# 2. ROIC Excluding Goodwill: A Focus on Core Operations

To address the distortion caused by goodwill, many investors turn to **ROIC excluding goodwill**. This version of ROIC removes goodwill from invested capital, providing a clearer view of how a company’s **operating assets** are performing—those assets generating returns day-to-day.

# Formula:

ROIC Excluding Goodwill=Invested Capital−Goodwill/Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT)​

# What ROIC Excluding Goodwill Tells You:

* **Core Efficiency**: By excluding goodwill, you get a more accurate picture of the core business's efficiency, separate from the impact of acquisitions.
* **Better View of Operating Assets**: Goodwill can inflate the asset base, masking how well the company’s actual operating assets are being used. Excluding it gives you a more accurate view of the true return on those assets.
* **Acquisition Risk**: If **ROIC excluding goodwill** is significantly higher than traditional ROIC, it may indicate that the company has overpaid for acquisitions.

# Example:

Let’s say a company has significant acquisitions and a large portion of its balance sheet tied up in goodwill. If ROIC excluding goodwill is notably higher than traditional ROIC, it signals that the core business is highly profitable, but past acquisitions may not have added as much value.

# 3. ROIIC: Return on Incremental Invested Capital

While ROIC and ROIC excluding goodwill help assess the efficiency of a company’s existing capital, **Return on Incremental Invested Capital (ROIIC)** shows how well a company is using **new capital**. ROIIC measures the returns generated on the additional capital invested over a specific period.

# Formula:

ROIIC=ΔInvested Capital/ΔNOPAT​

Where:

* **Δ NOPAT** is the change in Net Operating Profit After Tax over the period.
* **Δ Invested Capital** is the change in the company’s invested capital over the same period.

# What ROIIC Tells You:

* **Growth",ValueInvesting,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fof4zi/roic_vs_roic_excluding_goodwill_vs_roiic_which/

trans_kitty_,Reddit IPO questions from someone who has never invested into anything,1708638953,1axiz8y,0,1,"Will I need some sort of app or account to be able to purchase during the IPO? I tried looking through the FAQ that reddit put up but I'm still not sure. I know for most investments you have to open like a trade account using some sort of platform like Robinhood or Schwab or Nerdwallet or whatever but does an IPO ignore that sort of thing because it isn't yet a publicly traded option?   
I'm young and would actually like to put money in something where I know I can invest for my future, at least in the sort term if I pull out in 3-6 months to earn profit. But I don't know the steps I need to do before this IPO becomes live. I'm in the very early bracket (Reddit put out 75000 invites and I will likely be in the second buy group due to my karma and mod history) and everyone in investing says earlier is always better no?   
I understand there is a risk factor due to recent losses reddit has had recently but I wouldn't be surprised that if that is because a large amount of budget was allocated to this IPO process.

I'm sorry about the account I'm using for it, yes I am a degenerate internet whore, but these are genuine questions. I've looked at the Daily general discussion and will also post this there incase these questions are better suited there.

CSachen,Do all stocks go up because one stock goes up?,1708713611,1ay852f,0,68,"NVDA is a $2 trillion company, which is the third largest American company. As such, they make up a huge composition of market-weighted indices like the S&P and NASDAQ 100. Yesterday NVDA was up. Yesterday many other stocks were up.

Is there a causal relationship here?

It is clear that buying a stock within an index affects the index. It also clear that buying a fund that tracks the index also affects the stocks within the index. Every stock has a beta, which is the movement that can be explained via correlation to the overall market, and alpha, which is movement that is not explained via correlation to the overall market.

What I'm trying to understand is the nature of the relationship between NVDA vs indices ex-NVDA. Which of these is more true:

1) NDVA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> STOP. Movement in other stocks can be explained by other factors other than NVDA alone.

2) NVDA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> causes all stocks in the index to go up. A stock benefits simply by being tracked in the same index as NVDA,",investing,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ay852f/do_all_stocks_go_up_because_one_stock_goes_up/

So my fund has a large position in META and so, to confess, I am talking my book here. However, facts are that Zuck will, by the end of 2024, have purchases over 350,000 Nvidia H100 AI computers and will proprietary build another 300,000 H100 equivalent compute nodes. He has stated that here: https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/290456847348165/ Why all the AI compute? Rumor has it (and from a very reliable source also), that META's goal here is to become the AWS (Amazon Web Services) of AI compute for all large and small companies. META currently offers their LLaMA open source language model to the developer community for AI model development. Why open source versus closed proprietary models like ChatGTP? Perhaps so that the ultimate developed AI workload can run on the META hyperscale worldwide redundant server network - thus explaining the massive H100 infrastructure build currently being deployed. Proprietary language models like ChatGTP must be rented as a service and cannot be used for custom AI development instances. Most large entities and governments will want custom AI compute, and in many cases multiple instances of AI compute for different tasks (defense, crime fighting, tax collections, etc).  
Remember AWS is worth, by many estimates, more than Amazon's retail e-commerce division. What will META be worth when they are the primary provider of AI hosted infrastructure to start-ups, consumers, small and large businesses and world governments? Probably well over $3000 per share - and this increase in share price will occur rapidly within the next 3 years should it become evident META is becoming the AWS of AI. META remains, despite its recent massive run up, the cheapest of the mega-cap tech stocks (and in an election year advertising environment also....).  
So this is still a largely secret program at META (why let potential competitors like AWS know their strategy ahead of time). But, once announced, expect further gains in META's equity valuation - perhaps very substantial gains.

Imminent Shorting Opportunity Unveils...,1708617728,1ax9xr9,0,1,"The recent surge in the Dow Jones, reaching an all-time high, has captured the attention of investors globally. However, local indicators suggest a potential dip between today and the 5th of March, with the bottom anticipated to occur between the 16th and 22nd of March. This presents an intriguing opportunity for swing traders looking to capitalize on the expected market fluctuations.

What makes this situation particularly interesting is the insight derived from a thorough fundamental analysis of previous election cycles.

Any information on risks and if the profits are even worth it would be great!

  
I would genuinely be happy with paying my mortgage for one home and using this income to pay off the second home while also making an extra 2-300 dollars a month is ideal.

Upbeat_Variety8531,Use JEPI / Dividend Income Fund to grow Roth IRA Faster?,1722565540,1ehytmn,0,1,"So I was browsing some of the main investing sub reddits and ran across the following strategy which caught my attention but I don't know how feasible it is in practice.

I have personally thought about this strategy before  theoretically but never did the math on paper to see how it would turn out in practice.

Anyhow below is the strategy the person stated they used to grow their Roth IRA faster given its $7k yearly contribution limit.

Strategy
1. Invest 30-50% of yearly contribution into something such as JEPI or another high income dividend ETF

2. Use monthly / quarterly dividend payments to by more VOO (or VTI, any etf, etc)
-------

I need to dig into my history to see if I can find the post to directly link to it.

However, based on the above thought process, what's your take on the entire approach?

TLDR:  Let's say that you have a 20-30 year horizon for your Roth IRA, does it really make a big difference if you do perhaps a 70/30 or 50/50  split in the form of VOO / FXAiX//etc + JEPI/SCHD?

Interested in hearing everyone's feedback and if anyone else has tried this in their roth ira or trad irs's to try to grow it faster, thank you!

Interesting-Fuel238,S&P 500 calculator with true historical Rate of Return,1708094830,1asabvm,0,1,"A lot of people here (and investors in general) have a misconception that since the S&P 500 has ""averaged"" 11% their VOO and SPY funds should earn about that. Of course we know the truth about CAGR, that averages are meaningless. To recover from a -50% loss you need a 100% gain. While that would give you a return of zero, the ""average"" of those 2 numbers is 25%. So averages are useless and this is why actual advisors use return assumptions of 7% instead of 12% like radio show hosts.

PM_ME_GIIFT_CARDS,"Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC) ~34% Arbitrage Trade Opportunity, buy Bitcoin for $39,000",1708210519,1ateuly,0,1,"Hey I’m a lurker who rarely posts but am feeling compelled to make a DD here on a play which is objectively a solid opportunity. If you have a little bit of patience this could be a solid basically risk-free return.

We all know Bitcoin ETFs got approved last month – Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC) is a residual of the pre-ETF era and was an attempt to allow people to trade Bitcoin in a regular brokerage account before the spot ETFs. It was a much smaller version of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust with a smaller fee of 0.49% compared to GBTC’s 2%. The fund holds ~2700 BTC and has AUM of about ~$140MM. As of Friday close each share of the trust represents $17.05 worth of BTC at current market prices (~$52k/BTC at yesterday close) but the market closing price was $12.77 per share, roughly a 25% discount to net asset value and works out to a cost of only ~$39k/BTC. My thesis is that this massive discount is not justified at all and is an opportunity regardless of your opinion on BTC. Link to Osprey’s info on OBTC https://ospreyfunds.io/products/obtc/

In the pre-ETF era BTC could only be traded on regular exchanges in “trusts” where the custodian held the BTC and you could not create and redeem to cash like you can with the ETFs now. This made it so the market prices of the trusts like GBTC and OBTC could diverge from the market price of bitcoin by a lot. https://ycharts.com./companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav GBTC was trading at ~50% discount to NAV at one point when bitcoin sold off really hard and almost the same for OBTC https://ycharts.com./companies/OBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav at ~44%. For GBTC the discount has now closed completely as it has converted to an ETF so discount can be instantly arbitraged away. For OBTC the story has been a lot different. Leading up to ETF approvals the discount for OBTC started to shrink seemingly with the expectation that with ETFs being approved price-parity will be reached. Interestingly, the discount since the approval has actually grown and is at ~25% now which is higher than before SEC approved the ETFs and gave OBTC the opportunity to convert to an ETF if it wanted to. Osprey has not pursued converting to an ETF and I think the reasoning by redditor /u/Successful_Owl1678 https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/193vcxd/osprey_bitcoin_trust_obtc_conversion_to_an_etf/kj2kto4/ may be accurate as to why. Holders of the trust are, generally speaking, unhappy that the discount exists despite ETFs being out so Osprey decided to create a “tender offer” to buy shares at NAV to quell investors. The offer ended up getting blocked by the SEC earlier this month due to technicalities and since then the discount to NAV has grown to where it is now at 25%. Greg King, head of the trust, posted on Twitter after this happened https://twitter.com/GregKingOsprey/status/1755976720845324640 and said they are evaluating alternatives after the tender was blocked but just cannot speak publicly about their plans.

There seems to be negative sentiment since the tender offer was blocked which is causing the discount to grow but I think 25% is not warranted at all. Greg King and Osprey did and definitely still do have plans to let investors liquidate at NAV likely at some point in the near future, I am guessing at minimum in the next couple months as they initiated the tender right after ETF approval and are fairly responsive to investors (I emailed them for some info on the fund and they responded next day). Like mentioned OBTC is a small fund and trades OTC with low liquidity so this seems to have just flown under the radar and traders really haven’t noticed the arb opportunity.

To do this arbitrage trade you can long OBTC and short the same underlying BTC value of one of the other ETFs and be neutral to the price of BTC and pocket a roughly ~34% return when the NAV discount finally closes. If you’re bullish on BTC this is a good opportunity to buy at less than $40k when the price is now above $50k.

I assume it has something to do with bitcoin becoming a major medium of exchange (and since supply is capped price will have to rise as people buy in to use it for transactions, like silver in 18th century China). But even if you believe in the blockchain, what makes you confident that Bitcoin specifically will get widespread adoption, when it’s trivially easy to create new coins?

Ok-Tumbleweed-984,Advice on ways to grow NW beyond just investing taxable brokerage accounts? ,1708208652,1ate4w0,0,1,"I just posted my NW here. https://www.reddit.com/r/Money/s/Bv0P91fuL4 

What I am looking for is advice on any other ways to grow retirement non taxable accounts?? I have learned a lot from reddit and while I am seeking Financial advisors, I want to be informed independently too. 

For several reasons I am quite behind on my 401k value as it should be per my age (been contributing since 2010.)

Mistakes I think I made:

1. Started contributing late. Missed out on 3 years of contribution into 401k

2. Didnt max out 401k contribution until 2-3 yrs ago. Was contributing around 6% or so. Match was 1.5% for many years. 

3. Stopped contributing to Roth as I was above income limits starting 2017. Didnt take advantage of backdoor etc

4. Didnt reinvest dividends in non taxable accounts. (All reinvested now.)

5. Didnt take advantage of HSA.

6. Lost NW from Divorce. (No pre nup)

7. Didnt take advantage of additional contribution from my company for certain employees. ( a company benefit I missed out on).

What I am doing now:

1. Fully maxed out on 401k

2. Working through backdoor/megabackdoor to start the roth contributions each year.

3. Currently investing in Tbills (moved away from CDs) for tax reasons. (Laddered Tbills 6 months and a year). Doubt i”ll have this option in the future.

4. In 8 yrs when I am 50 and if the law still allows then I”ll take advantage of  the catch up contribution but its not much. 

No HSA available to me. 

My Question - What else can I do to grow my non taxable account value? 

Is all my NW going to come from taxable accounts? With high CA taxes, lawyer fees each year (hoping it will be resolved next by end of year) and forced to put house purchase on hold I dont know what else to do other than start really cutting on expenses to Grow my savings.

NW: ~ 1M; break down is as follows:

1. 290k in brokerage account

2. 200k Tbills

3. 100k HYSA which is my EF

4. 200k 401k, TiRA and Roth

5. 210k in RSUs vested

HHI: 600k depending on stock price.

(Car loan is already deducted from the liquid assets I have. No CC debt as its paid off every month. I Invest 1000 per month in stocks since last 2 yrs - had a gap of 3-4 months due to large expenses. Saving 5-10% each paycheck into HYsA.) 

Everything currently points to just building and growing my taxable assets - brokerage, HYSA and perhaps in the future rental / primary property. 

Is that really the case?",investing,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ate4w0/advice_on_ways_to_grow_nw_beyond_just_investing/

On September 28, 2018, AAPL hit an all time high of $56.44. It was followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018. Almost a 30% decline. I’m sure it hurt investors at the time. And I’m sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying “I shouldn’t have bought at all time highs when it’s so overvalued.” However, if they held for about 5 years until today they’re probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I’d personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn’t as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible.

SeaEvent4666,Interest rate for loaning money to flip houses.,1708008072,1argxca,0,1,"I have a guy that flips houses and sells them for a profit. He does multiple houses at a time. He buys the houses with cash offers  and flips them and then sells them for a profit. He gets the money for this from private lenders like myself and not banks. I’ve been doing this with him for 7 years or so. Everything has gone well. My question is he gives me 10% per annual interest for borrowing the money. So if I loan him $300,000 you multiply that by .10 and divide that by 12 (months) therefor he gives me $2,500.00 a month. He usually gives the capital back anywhere from 3-6 months. All of his work is insured and contracts are done to protect me and all that good stuff. 

My question is does anybody else do this? Is 10% a good rate for me or could I get more? I had a different guy that wanted to do something similar and he heard I got 10% and so he said he would give me 11% just to get me to switch. The big difference is he wants me to sign a 5 year contract with my money. He also mentioned how it usually works is the longer the loan the lower the interest rate.

prof_dorkmeister,Basis calculation for taxation on dividends,1708008531,1arh3cw,0,1,"I'm trying to understand what the cost basis will be on my dividend bearing stocks, because the way it is shown in my Etrade account is a bit confusing.  I'll simplify the question...

Suppose I buy 10 shares of XYZ at $100 each.  2 years later, I've gotten some quarterly dividends from XYZ, so that I now own 10.5 shares.  But the price of the stock has fallen to $99 a share.

I only paid $1000 for my stock.  But with the extra shares, and despite the drop in value, it is now worth $1039.50.

Etrade shows each of these dividend transactions as a cost to me, even though I didn't lay out any extra money.  They are deposited as shares, because I DRIP them back.  So in this case, Etrade would show my total cost as $1050, and net me a loss on paper of $10.50.

How will I be taxed when I sell?  Does the fact that I used DRIP to acquire the stock matter when calculating the basis?

wildbill_89,opinions on my investment strategy.,1708715123,1ay8rhw,0,1,"Hi there! I’m looking for some opinions on my investment strategy.   
Assume this scenario:  
\- Mid 30’s.  
\- Saving \~100k per year.  
\- Current portfolio is several hundred thousand. 2/3 in cash 1/3 in VFV.  
\- Wanting to “retire” in 6-8 years with \~$3,500/month in dividend income.  
The thing I care about most is monthly cashflow. I’m not hugely concerned with overall capital appreciation as long as my monthly income is enough to cover living expenses. For instance, if I can have a \~8% yield on cost on $750,000 I’m fine with that, rather than spending time building to 1.5M yielding 4%.   
I want a simple ETF system I can continuously plug excess cash into to keep growing monthly income.  
Rather than investing purely in more growth oriented ETFs, I’m thinking of focusing mostly on Canadian and USA dividend aristocrat tracking ETFs with decent dividend growth rates, and just building that up with DRIP and new contributions over the next several years.   
Attached are some images that represent my estimated numbers.  
I would be interested to hear your opinions on this strategy, rather than investing for capital growth, focus more on dividend growth over a medium time horizon.   
My portfolio would hold ETFs like CDZ, HYLD, VEQT, XEI, and perhaps some VFV.  
If you look at the rough math, even the capital appreciation works out similar to a growth focus when you factor in DRIP. On top of that, if stocks go down, then DRIP just buys more for the money, increasing overall income.    
Is there anything I’m missing or not considering?

wholemilksupreme,Savings for 6-10 year timeline,1708619261,1axakx2,0,1,"Hello, I was wondering if I could get some opinions on my investment plan for my taxable account? For context, I’m in my young 20’s and on track to max out all my tax advantaged accounts. 

So far, I have my emergency fund in USFR, but I’m unsure what to do with my extra savings. I’ve been DCA’ing into VOO every paycheck, but now I’ve been thinking about less volatility if my plans ever change to save for a down payment or large future expenses (maybe in 6-10 years?). Would it make sense to start with 80% VOO and then 20% of a bond ETF while slowly reallocating to more bonds once I get closer to my timeline. 

Another option I’ve been thinking about is going 100% VOO to let it grow and switch to dividends like SCHD in the far future. Once I have a better idea of my down payment timeline, I can start prioritizing it more in terms of contributions?

Curious to know which option you guys find more reasonable? Are there any ETFs or investments you guys would recommend?

TBSchemer,When is the best time to roll an IRA to Roth? ,1708620015,1axawcd,0,1,"I had an old 401k from a previous job that was performing atrociously for years, and I decided to roll it to an IRA to get better investment options. Mission accomplished, and it's now growing comfortably, but I'm realizing that I might want to use the backdoor Roth strategy in the future, and would be hit by the pro-rata rule. 

When would be the best time to roll this thing to Roth? Are there any strategies that would make this easier? Some considerations:

- The current size of the account is $12k. I could afford the taxes on that, but it would eat up nearly the entire raise I just got.

- The markets are at all-time highs. I know it would be best to roll when the markets are down, but there's no way to time a crash. The longer I wait to roll, the higher my tax bill could potentially get. 

- I don't expect to lose my job anytime soon, but who does? 

Is it better to put off paying taxes as long as possible, but potentially pay higher total taxes in the long-term through pro-rata as the account grows? Or is it better to just get it out of the way now, before the account grows any larger?

LoTheReaper,How to read ratios from Yahoo Finance,1708643631,1axkxfn,0,3,"I was frustrated trying to look these all up separately, so I'm making my own post as a reference. I took an investing course and these are generally the numbers that are good.

This is not an exhaustive list, but please reply in the comments with ratios I've missed, and what numbers we should be looking for so people can open this, and search the thread.

A good **Sharpe ratio** typically falls within the following ranges:  
  
Greater than 1.0: Considered acceptable to good by investors.  
Higher than 2.0: Rated as very good.  
3.0 or higher: Considered excellent.  
Under 1.0: Considered sub-optimal

**Beta** \- Measure of risk. A score of 1 matches the market. 1.5 means if the market moves 1, that stock moves 1.5. A score of 0.5 means if the market moves 1, it moves 0.5. Higher the number, the more volatility. 

A good **Treynor ratio** is typically higher than the market’s ratio, which serves as a benchmark. Historical data suggests that the market’s ratio is usually around 1.

**Price/earnings (P/E) ratio** \- Lower the better. Less than 2.5 is good.

**Price/sales (P/S) ratio** \- Lower the better. 1.0 - 2.0 is good. Less than 1, excellent.

**Price/Earnings/Growth (PEG) ratio** \- Below 1.0 is good value

**Price/book ratio** \- Range 1.0 - 3.0. Less than 1.0 is excellent.

**Enterprise Value/revenue ratio (EV/R)** \- Good is between 1.0 - 3.0. Lower is better.

**Enterprise value/ EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) (EV/EBITDA)** \- Less than 10. Lower is better.

**Price/cash flow (P/CF)** \- 10 or less. Lower is better

**Price/free cash flow (P/FCF)** \- 15 or less. Lower is better.

**Dividend payout ratio** \- Less than 50% excellent. 50-70% good. The higher, the more cautious you should be.",investing,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axkxfn/how_to_read_ratios_from_yahoo_finance/

I'm finally getting ready to purge and sure enough I have no cost basis info in my brokerage account (with Schwab) for that distribution. To make it worse, my old brokerage was sold off to Schwab in 2020, so tracking anything before that has been difficult. I have a research ticket open with the old org, but the rep I spoke too was not optimistic.

I guess my question is, is there a fixed cost basis for when that stock was distributed? Is there a standard way to track that down?

Instead of that I could… I have two goals work for myself, and achieve F.I.R.E (financial independence retirement early) and I believe this could be a good opportunity. My father who invests in real estate on the side owns 4-6 properties as while as fix and flips. Is looking to buy a business or franchise. Where I could work there full time, be the manager and eventually buy him out or buy another one with him 50/50 then buy my own business or invest ini real estate, as while as fix and flip on the side (I already own a 50/50 condo with him, which is rented out)

So my questions are 

-Is this a good idea? Will it let me achieve my goals I would like to fire before 30 I know it’s ambitious but also possible as you can make alot fix and flipping on the side as while as owning a business. (My fire number is 8000 a month) 

-If so what business should my father get in to, which will give the best outcome for these goals?

Webhead24-7,Buy high or find something else?,1708098384,1asbqw2,0,28,"Hello everyone.  I promise this is not a ""I have $X to invest"" post.

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.

All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.

So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?

I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.

TL:DR
I guess you could boil this down to a simple question.

And until we're ready to buy we also want our money to be making money for us over while we wait. 

Our first thoughts were to keep our future down payment savings in one or two HYSAs earning about 4.5% APY since they're at a 15-year high. However, I know once the fed funds rate starts coming down, probably in the second half of this year, so will the rates for HYSAs. Another option we've considered is putting our down payment savings into CDs which will lock in a better rate (\~5.4%) for a year even if the fed funds rate goes down. 

I've also considered putting some of our savings into a brokerage account and using it to invest in the S&P 500 (likely FXAIX) and letting it grow over the next 2+ years. This could have greater returns. But of course we then run the risk of losing some of that money if the market drops.

bcg85,Input on retirement/investment choices,1707798996,1apkxq2,0,5,"Current biographical/financial picture:
Late 30's, working (part-time) spouse, $100k mortgage, $12k savings, ~$20k other debt (all low-interest...vehicles, etc, no monthly balance on credit cards). Total combined yearly gross income of ~$90k. Any raises from here out will only be cost if living raises, I am topped out on our pay scale.

I have 12 years in my career with 18 years to go before my earliest retirement date with unreduced pension (HRA not included, but is available if I stay for an additional 8 years which is just not happening). Current pension estimated at ~$4200/month if I retire at the earliest date..

I got into the retirement planning portion of my career a little late, but have been contributing to a 457b deferred comp plan for the past 6 years. I do $300/month, and increase a little each year ($25-$50) with raises. The contributions thus far have all been traditional/pre-tax, but I am now able to make Roth contributions, which I have switched to. I manage it myself and currently have it all in stocks, but I rebalance it every year. Last year I managed a 22% RoR, but the annual average is around 10% (2022 was rough). Current balance is around $30k.


I've had an experimental brokerage account for a few years and have done nothing but lose about $2k with it. I'm not good at actually trading stocks, so last year I started investing in ETFs/index funds. I'm still largely uneducated in that realm, but there were at least gains. That account has a balance of about $6k.

I also dipped into crypto back in the day when bitcoin was around $250, and prematurely sold them all in 2018 for $20k instead of becoming a millionaire, but that's a different story. I still have about $2.5k in various crypto right now.

This year I opened two IRA's, one traditional and one Roth. I plan to max out my contributions to them for the 2023 tax year using some of the remaining funds in my brokerage account, along with income tax returns. I also plan to max out throughout the 2024 year with monthly paycheck contributions, with a 60/40 split going mostly into the Roth fund.

Both of the IRA's have mixed investments in SWLGX, FXAIX, FSELX, CHGX, SDY, VUG, VOO, VXUS, VNQ and VTI. I will admit, I don't know a lot of details on investment selection, and am aware these may not be optimal.

I'm not looking to retire, buy a lavish yacht and travel the world on a bottomless budget. I just want to live the same lifestyle as we currently enjoy without having to work anymore once I get there to keep it up. Maybe also have a small nest egg to leave the kids, since that's a luxury my wife and I never had.

So my questions are as follow:

1. Does my current retirement forecast seem reasonable given the above investment information?

2. Should I consider consolidating the IRA's into either just Roth or just traditional? I am not sure what my tax forecast for the future is, which is why I chose to split them up.

3. Should I keep the diversified investments or switch to one fund (I've seen a lot of people talk about VITAX, for example)?

And I’m sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying “I shouldn’t have bought at all time highs when it’s so overvalued.” However, if they held for about 5 years until today they’re probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I’d personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn’t as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible.

anonoman010101,I think the owner of the company I work for is stuck in a ponzi scheme. How to proceed?,1707879876,1aqcmj1,0,156,"Anonymous one time post. I handle the financials for a guy and his multiple companies. The owner of the company I work for has an investment broker, he's been around for a handful of few years. Almost every month (more in recent months than previously) the broker tells him he can get him a 30% return, the minimum he can buy in for every month is a million - which he takes in towards the end of every month. The owner has invested many millions and gets an interest check at the beginning of every month. I talk with both the owner and the broker fairly regularly. I was told that an extra million invested increases the monthly interest by about $23k - so annually that's about 28%. The broker has made comments such as, ""I have up to $10M available for this investment this month"". I don't know what it's actually invested in - although he does get a statement, I just haven't looked close enough at what it's invested in (although if it truly is a ponzi scheme, the statement very well could be fake). The owner has mentioned this to many other professionals he works with and many of them have reached out to me about how it's very fishy. I met the investment broker once, as did one of these other professionals, and we both had the same reaction - the broker is very arrogant, super questionable, and just comes off as a complete scum bag.

The broker is listed on the website for a major investment bank. He's listed on Advisor Check and Broker Check and has what looks like a clean record - over a dozen years experience with multiple firms, multiple exams passed, licensed in 30+ states. 

Am I thinking wrong here? I just can't believe the return, it's completely unrealistic. It's also odd that the minimum is $1m and the guy is trying to sell more investments at the end of every month, then paying out interest at the beginning of every month - seems a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I've thought about making an anonymous tip to the SEC, but I feel like I'm risking a lot by doing so. I don't even know how to approach this. In my mind there's no chance this is legit, but at the same time, the interest checks have been coming in without issue.

So CSPX is an SP500 ETF that is domiciled in Ireland and is good for foreign investors as it is accumulating and doesn't put us at risk of getting hit with a US estate tax if and when we croak. 

If you look at the chart I posted, I dunno why this ETF has these huge price ranges on certain days, which correspond to large trading volumes as well. 

I'm worried that due to low liquidity, there may be some ""lemme try my luck"" sell orders people have submitted that are getting filled by other people submitting market orders. I have been wanting to setup a recurring investment order for a few of these ETFs but I'm worried that a DCA order goes to the exchange as a Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) order and it might get filled at some ridiculous price if there is no/low liquidity. I'm not exactly clear how the VWAP orders work but is this something to be worried about? Are these types of orders causing these weird price ranges on certain days?",investing,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1arhg7c/what_is_going_on_in_this_sp500_etf_cspx_why_are/

A third one is [Lance Roberts](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/insights/real-investment-daily/) from Real Investment Advice, although sometimes a bit loony, but he usually shows data that is not noticed by anyone else.

_kanana,My gains. Went from BK shifts to buying a BMW X7 tomorrow. AMA,1727195781,1fogvuv,0,40,"Been a wild ride this year. Managed to turn some small options plays (stuff like TSLA, AAPL, etc.) into over 2500% gains (screenshot). Honestly still shocked, but I think I’m finally going to quit options trading and just leave everything in index funds like Nasdaq.

I started small - working overtime at Burger King and jumped into trading during the pandemic. Put my $15k life savings into it, and after 4 years of stress, ups and downs, and way too much coffee, I’m sitting in the millions.

Some huge plays on stocks like TSLA and AMD were major factors, but I got lucky on a lot of these too.
AMA tho.

FAQ:
1 - Most my gains are on daytrading/swinging/momentum plays
2- I was lucky a lot of the times (was following signals)
3 - DO NOT DM ME - I do NOT answer DMs.

seenyourballs,Reluctant to start contributing funds,1709600000,1b6rs2u,0,1,"My wife and I have finally paid off all our debt. Now we have been looking into maximizing our contributions to our 401k/Roth IRA accounts. I have reviewed some of the plans and want to eventually go all in on the s&p500 plan as opposed to a overall market or cash holdings. The problem is that the market seems rediculously overvalued right now. We are able to max out contributions but only for the next couple years(we pay low rent to my parents but will move in a couple years). I have a fear that we would be putting in a huge portion of cash for these upcoming years at the ATH’s just for it to crash right when our circumstances change meaning we will not be able to DCA as much as we currently are right now. A reduction in DCA’ing our contributions when the price is low would not be great and would make it even harder to us to lower our cost average. I don’t know if I necessarily want to keep the current money in the cash holdings plan and try to time the market for the best time to get in. But it doesn’t feel great starting contributions when it feels like we’re in a bubble. The last 12 or so years have been a massive bull run, I just don’t see it continuing for much longer. I know the general advice is time in the market rather than timing the market but I just don’t want to squander any money. Should I keep some stached away to make a more averaged DCA amount mount over the course of 10 years or just plow it in to s&p500 rn or keep it in the cash plan for the right time to buy? Any advice for moderate risk?

At this moment this 70K is my only liquid cash. 

In September I left my job to focus on my studies and renewed my Master’s program and do not have much income, at least not what I was used to (right now around ~€1000/month through some odd jobs I do). I plan to go back to work in the end of this year and will be probably taking home ~€3000-4000/month. 

So what is your verdict? Obviously, I am getting a financial advisor, but I was curious about the answers here as well. Or maybe some questions I should ask the advisor/or what to be wary of. Really, anything that comes to mind.

All told, there were 422,000 retirement savers in Fidelity 401(k) plans sporting balances of seven figures and beyond as of Dec. 31, up from 349,000 at the end of September and 299,000 at the end of 2022.  
  
There were also 391,562 IRA millionaires on Dec. 31, up from 338,725 at the end of September and 280,320 at the end of December 2022.  
  
""We are encouraged to see retirement balances increase so dramatically this quarter, reflecting the improving market conditions and enabling retirement savers to see significant gains in their account balances and retirement preparedness,"" Michael Shamrell, vice president of thought leadership for Fidelity Workplace Investing, told Yahoo Finance.

401(k) millionaire keys to swelling balances  
So, who are these millionaires, and what’s their secret sauce?  
  
First, they go the distance. The average savings tenure of Fidelity account millionaire savers is 26 years. What that tells us is that it pays to continue to invest steadily over the long term. The average age of a retirement account millionaire is 59.  
  
""The key to saving for retirement is playing the long game and maintaining consistent contributions over time,"" Shamrell said. ""The increase in the number of 401(k) millionaires is a perfect example, as the majority of these savers aren’t necessarily doing anything special other than saving at a high rate in the same plan over a long period of time.""  
  
Nearly half of Fidelity’s millionaires are boomers, which was on par with the number of Gen X millionaires. Millennials accounted for just 0.8%.  
  
Another key takeaway: It takes more than simply investing paycheck after paycheck for decades or a roaring stock market to make it over that bar. The new millionaire club members save on steroids.  
  
The Fidelity breakdown shows that they save 17.5% of their pay on average. Their employers contribute an additional 9% to their retirement accounts for a total savings rate of 26.6%.",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b442iq/401k_millionaire_keys_to_swelling_balances_so_who/

YounggWeezyy,Investing at 19: Roth IRA vs. Individual Taxable Brokerage Account,1709515269,1b5y3fq,0,1,"Hey everyone,  
I've been considering whether I should start investing in a Roth IRA now or stick with my regular brokerage account. I'm 19 and trying to make smart financial decisions for my future.  
With my current job, I can contribute about $100 per month to a Roth IRA, which fits within my budget. I understand I can only contribute up to the amount I make in a year if I cant max it out. Some people say I might miss the accessibility of funds in a regular brokerage account, but after looking into it, I'm not too worried.  
In a regular account, I can sell stocks and use the money, but I'll have to pay taxes on any profits. However, with a Roth IRA, I can't touch the profits until I'm nearly 60 without penalties, but I can withdraw the money I put in without any penalties or taxes. So, the accessibility concern isn't a big issue for me since I'm planning on keeping it for retirement.  
I've done the math, and even with just $100 a month and a 7% return, starting a Roth IRA now could mean an extra $50,000 in my account by the time I retire compared to waiting 3 years until I land my first full-time job after college where I plan on opening one anyway.  
So, what's the downside of starting a Roth IRA now? I don't really see one. It seems like a smart move to take advantage of compound interest and set myself up for a better retirement later on.  
What do you all think? If my logic is wrong anywhere please let me know. Right now it seems like it would be dumn to continue to invest in a taxable account before a Roth. ",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b5y3fq/investing_at_19_roth_ira_vs_individual_taxable/

I’m currently working 60 hours a week plan is to stay here for about 10yrs which then my house will be paid off ($900k). Then change jobs to only work around 50 hours a week. So question is should I just keep 401k n keep putting as much as I can or only put 2% to get the match n rest to Roth IRA? 401k sounds better because I’ll be working less hours so less taxable income when I eventually pull $ from 401k but am I wrong? ,investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b5yhyk/keep_pumping_401k_or_split_with_roth/

Vasili_Wears_Shorts,Multi-Account Strategy (Feedback),1709519936,1b5zpv4,0,1,"Hi there,

I could use an opinion on my portfolio construction between my 3 Canadian accounts (RRSP/RPP, TFSA & Margin).

I'm finding it difficult to articulate, but I'll try and explain it as simple as I can.

&#x200B;

Background:

* Active part-time trader \~4 years in
* Now looking to create a S&P portfolio and trade around different ETF positions using options, shares, & futures.
* Bi-weekly SPY payroll purchases in RRSP/RPP
* Bi-weekly TFSA deposits to be added to different SPDR sector funds
* Assume equal portfolio weight % between the three accounts

&#x200B;

RRSP/RPP

* 80% SPY
   * Shares
* 20% Cash - SPY options hedge

TFSA

* 50-80% SPDR Sector funds & commodity ETFs
   * XLK, XLF, XLV, XLY, XLC, XLI, XLP, XLE, XLRE, XLB, XLU
   * Shares
* 20-50% Cash - SPY options Hedge

Essentially long-term holds, but will move allocation around if necessary, never 100% liquidating a position.

  
Futures margin account

* medium to longer length trades in ES/NQ and commodities (CL/BT/NG etc.)
* More activity in my margin account based on the intended duration of each trade.

&#x200B;

Effectively I'm long SPY, but playing a more active role in moving around different sector allocation based on market demand, and using options and futures to hedge against downside volatility.

I'm not too interested in creating portfolios outside of US markets because for me less is more, and if I can simplify my portfolio, I should be able to make money both ways, and let's face it, US markets will always continue to be the strongest.

Note: I'm aware that I'm not fully hedged with only 20% cash in both RRSP & TFSA, but due to ongoing dollar cost averaging, I always have the ability to reduce my average.

Curious if anyone else has thought of structuring their portfolio like this? I have no friends to think out loud to in this space - would love to hear whatever you have to say.

&#x200B;

Thank you,

Vasili

Valvador,Revenue Weighted indexes vs Market Cap Weighted indexes,1709326889,1b45fcw,0,5,"**Disclosure:** I am ass at investing, just a math and science guy who only started seriously about a year ago or so, so please feel free to call me out on any misconceptions or BS you see here. I don't have any money on SPY or RWL. I'm a boring old VTI + VXUS + Treasuries + My Employer and chill kinda guy right now.

I feel like I've been watching a lot of people complaining about S&P500 or just passive index investing causing things to inflate. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6nHqwkZOZg) (it's a dry video, which is good) talks about some of these concerns raised, and specifically the concern about companies being too invested into the ""Magnificent 7"". 

I wanted to think about this a little more fundamentally.

**What does being Market Cap Weighted Mean?: SPY**

[SPY Composition](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)

The thing that stood out to me is that Market cap weighted indexes are distributed based on market perception, right? Market cap of companies is often based on future returns, not the current state of the business. This means, SPY or S&P500 is currently weighted based on the expected return in the future, which means it's a heavy bet into the future. What does that mean today? Based on how heavily the magnificent 7 are invested into AI for future gains, it seems like a pretty heavy bet on AI. 

So while the future gains based on the bet that AI is going to generate these companies more revenue is driving the SPY high, what happens if this gamble is wrong? What happens if AI doesn't increase profits significantly, not to the amount the market is hyping up?

**Revenue Weighted ETFs - Bet on Current Profits: RWL**

[RWL Composition](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/rwl/holdings/)

So what does the S&P500 look like if you're focused current profitability and want to bet on companies that are profitable right now are going to continue to be profitable? Turns out it's pretty different. Walmart is all the way at the top, and Microsoft isn't there until number 13. If anything, this is an interesting insight on current profitability vs expected future profitability.

The biggest risk here is that a company that is profitable today isn't necessarily profitable in the future. In some ways it feels safer because if the bets on current trends (like AI) are wrong, you have your money in companies that are profitable TODAY... but there is a problem: 

* Revenue is a direct fundamental result of prior years of work, but for certain companies that Revenue isn't consistent. 
* A video game publisher may have a massive year, followed by shitty years, and any company with inconsistent returns like this will bounce around in it's placement of a revenue weighted ETF.
* Normally, a Market Cap allocation compensates for this because usually companies with inconsistent returns like this tend to have lower P/E Ratio due to active traders being aware of these differences.

**Fundamental Bet on the Companies vs the Market**

So the main difference to me feels like a bet on the Companies vs the Market. I don't fully understand the picture, but based on this discussion so far it seems like one thing that Revenue-weighted ETFs miss out on is essentially riding the waves of what active investors may know. As mentioned in the example where a company with inconsistent revenues year to year may hop around in your RWL allocation, I would expect that company remain pretty stable in the SPY because the market already knows this company and has priced it accordingly to its volatility... not something a Revenue Weighted market can do. 

Maybe you can eliminate some of this volatility by having a revenue weighted ETF based on last 5 - 10 years of revenue, but now you're in the land of living in the past and fundamentally betting on the past instead of riding the active market into the future.

A little context on my situation -I just started sorting out my Finances that I neglected when I was younger (I just turned 34). I spent the last couple years paying off all my debt and ended up draining my savings account in the process (it was only about $15k)

This year I focused on maxing out my Roth IRA and have already set a decent amount of my paycheck to contribute to my 401k. I've mostly Rebuilt my emergency fund so I will soon have about $100 a week in extra money which I was looking to invest.

I was thinking about splitting it 50/50 between SCHD and VOO but i'm not sure if thats the best option?

My thought process is that SCHD would be able to provide a supplemental dividend income in retirement but it seems like it might be best if I have a lump sum to invest for that?

Zeus_516,Thoughts on Pfizer?,1721080376,1e47e20,0,1,"**Disclaimer:** I don't own any Pfizer. I'm a 21-year-old with about 3 years in the market. I'm still an amateur investor learning what makes a company a good investment option. 

I've been doing some research into new investment options to try and diversify my portfolio a bit, as I'm overweight in the tech/semiconductor sector. I've been reading up on Pfizer as a long-term hold and was curious to hear everyone's thoughts on it.

Right now, it's fairly cheap, closing at $29.10 today (7/15/24). It's got a couple of things going for it that make me interested in potentially buying. 

First off, it has a very attractive dividend, at $1.68 a year (5.0891%) it seems like a solid option to invest in and then let grow under its own weight. Secondly, they are working on a new weight-loss drug that is in the late stages of tier 3(?) trials. Other weight-loss drugs have been very profitable (looking at you Ozempic) and Pfizer has a lot of name recognition from during Covid. In theory, it could prove to be a very lucrative addition to their portfolio of drugs and pharmaceuticals. 

This is where my lack of education is going to go on full display: the financials of the company. It has a P/E ratio of 0.0 and a profit margin of 22.12%. Pfizer has what I understand to be a high debt/capital percentage at 42.73%, but has beaten earnings expectations over the last 4 quarters (Q2 2023 to Q1 2024).

I try to do thorough research, but I'm not sure how much all of these statistics play in (again, very much an amateur here) but I figured they might be useful pieces of info to have. I've seen a mixture of reviews with a lot of analysts thinking it's either a good buy or a money pit, so I wanted to see what the lovely people of Reddit thought about it.

Thank you in advance for any input or other advice you might have!

goldandkarma,Thoughts on HITI (High Tide Inc.)?,1718987121,1dl82km,0,1,"I’ve been looking into this company and am quite drawn to it for the following reasons:

1. Disciplined approach to growth and expansion (moreso than other cannabis players) 

2. Solid financials. Growing revenues, free cash flow positive and generally positive growth trends

3. Great international expansion opportunities. They’ve already proven they can do it by entering the UK market. They’re currently eyeing germany and are well-positioned to potentially enter the US market if federal legalization happens

4. Expanding customer bases and market shares in the markets in which they operate, indicative of a solid business model and happy consumers

It seems to me as though the company is quite undervalued as is given current financials and future growth potential. Moreover, it seems as though many investors may be irrationally staying away from the cannabis sector due to its highly volatile history. However this is less of a concern as the company has now matured and is on a steady growth trajectory.

StatQuants,"Regulators hit Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America over living will plans",1718994621,1dlb1jh,0,58,"KEY POINTS

* Banking regulators on Friday disclosed that they found weaknesses in the resolution plans of four of the eight largest American lenders.
* The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that the so-called living wills of Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America filed in 2023 were inadequate.
* Regulators found fault with the way each of the banks planned to unwind their massive derivatives portfolios; derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.

Banking regulators on Friday [disclosed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240621a.htm) that they found weaknesses in the resolution plans of four of the eight largest American lenders.

The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that the so-called living wills — plans for unwinding huge institutions in the event of distress or failure — of [Citigroup](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/), [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) and [Bank of America](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/) filed in 2023 were inadequate.

Regulators found fault with the way each of the banks planned to unwind their massive derivatives portfolios. Derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.

For example, when asked to quickly test Citigroup’s ability to unwind its contracts using different inputs than those chosen by the bank, the firm came up short, [according](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) to the regulators. That part of the exercise appears to have snared all the banks that struggled with the exam.

“An assessment of the covered company’s capability to unwind its derivatives portfolio under conditions that differ from those specified in the 2023 plan revealed that the firm’s capabilities have material limitations,” regulators [said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) of Citigroup.

The living wills are a key regulatory exercise mandated in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Every other year, the largest US. banks must submit their plans to credibly unwind themselves in the event of catastrophe. Banks with weaknesses have to address them in the next wave of living will submissions due in 2025.

While JPMorgan, Goldman and Bank of America’s plans were each deemed to have a “shortcoming” by both regulators, Citigroup was considered to have a more serious “deficiency” by the FDIC, meaning that the plan wouldn’t allow for an orderly resolution under U.S. bankruptcy code.

Since the Fed didn’t concur with the FDIC on its assessment of Citigroup, it was overall deemed to have the less-serious “shortcoming” grade.

“We are fully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators,” New York-based Citigroup said in a statement.

“While we’ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we’ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas,” the bank said. “More broadly, we continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds.”",stocks,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dlb1jh/regulators_hit_citigroup_jpmorgan_chase_goldman/

Eaxecx,Bitcoin - Busting the Myth of Value and Money,1707818047,1appvhu,0,1,"Let's say that someone trades a car for a monopoly bill. According to a popular myth, after such a transaction, this bill became valuable. You as market participants gave it value. Also, that bill became money, and is now comparable to dollars, euros or pounds. 

Is the above myth true? Can a paper with some number on it have value and be money simply because market participants accepted it by trading stuff for it? Is it really that simple? Well of course not. That myth is false. Everyone can put numbers on some medium, either paper or digital, while others can then accept or buy this. However, no value or money is created by doing so. Numbers by themselves are just mathematical abstractions and have no value. And if they don't have value they cannot be money because it is impossible to determine how much of goods or services is worth accenting for a specific number. Why would you, for example, accept the number ""1"" and not ""9"" in exchange for a beer or a haircut? Obviously, in those characters, there's no value that can be compared with the value of beer or haircut. Consequently, rational market exchange is impossible. 

In the case of Bitcoin, an anonymous person with the alias Satoshi Nakamoto came up with a protocol that puts numbers on a digital medium. Others then accept these numbers - either by trading them for electricity needed to decentrally store them, or by just buying them on the market. When they buy the number ""1"" they say that they bought 1 electronic coin or bitcoin (short BTC). But this is just a metaphorical expression given that everyone who ""buys Bitcoin"" gets only a number on the screen. Anyhow, these Bitcoin purchases are completely irrational. There is a well-known example of a pizzeria owner who traded two pizzas for the number ""10,000"". Why did he accept that number and not ""5"", ""100"" or ""800,000""? Well, no rational reason existed. There was no value that he could compare with the value of two pizzas and determine which string of characters is worth accepting. So he accepted ""10,000"" blindly, as some kind of a joke. 

This joke-like event established the starting price of $0.001 for the number ""1"". Then, a global market mania began that skyrocket the price from $0.001 to a whopping $69,000, currently $50,000. It is unbelievable that people are paying that much money for a mathematical abstraction in the form of ""1"". For something that everyone can create by a stroke of a pen or press of a key on a keyboard. 

That's why it is necessary to bust the above-mentioned myth by explaining which numbers are money and which are not. 

For numbers to have value and be money they must be redeemable by their issues. Gold certificates were an example of such. The same as monopoly money or bitcoins they were numbers written on a medium. However, unlike the former, they were redeemable. Their issuers were liable to give a specific quantity of gold to their bearers. The bigger the number the more gold a bearer would receive. Simply put, numbers on gold certificates had redemption value. Market participants could then compare that value to the value of beers or haircuts and make rational market transactions. 

Euros, dollars or pounds work similarly. They are numbers - either on banknotes or bank accounts, but redeemable numbers. Their issuers - banks, redeem them for debt servicing and liens release. Namely, these numbers are issued as debt and are recorded as assets of banks in their balance sheets. Individuals and companies owe them to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe them to central banks based on bonds. The same numbers are also recorded in the banks' balance sheets as their liabilities. Banks are liable to redeem them for reducing or closing the debt they created and releasing liens on the property that secures it. For example. If a bank is liable to remove a lien from a car title when a debtor returns the number 40,000 to it, the value of that number is equal to the value of the car.

salinedaily,Preparing for daughters future,1717332950,1d6cpec,0,8,"As the title says, I have a daughter and I’m attempting to set her up well for when she’s an adult. Nobody did this for me and I want better for my child. She is 6 months old roughly now and I was thinking over the next 16-20 years I could have her enough money saved/invested for a starter car, maybe a year or two of college tuition, or whatever she may need at that time. 

As of now I have $300 in a minors savings account for her. Times are hard right and I’m only able to afford putting back about $50 a month for her, but at least it’s something. That $50 could maybe turn into $100 or even more in the future when I get I. My feet a little more. 

My question is if just putting it in a savings account is the best option? I would think not, but I don’t really know all the options I have. I’ve heard a lot about a Roth IRA but I’m under the impression she won’t get that money until she retires and defeats the purpose of what I want to use the money for. 
I’ve heard I could put it in a CD over and over until she’s ready for it and it will grow a lot by doing that. I have no knowledge of investing or how to save so if you have any advice explain it to me like I’m 10 year old. I live in Northern Alabama if that matters with like which banks and investing firms are around me. Probably doesn’t matter, haha. 

Anyways, yeah, just want to do the best for my daughter with what I have. TIA.",investing,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d6cpec/preparing_for_daughters_future/

readonly-account,"Interpreting ""Settlement Date""",1716923198,1d2rj12,0,1,"I usually don't perform frequent trades, but recently got dinged for selling shares purchased with unsettled funds. The thing is, this broker usually puts up a warning the moment you purchase something with unsettled funds, alerting you that you can't sell that until the funding sale finally settles. I got no such warning this time, and didn't expect one due to my reading of Settlement Date. \*\*Especially in light of the new T+1 rule, are funds ""settled"" at the START of the sale's ""Settlement Date"", or the END of the sale's ""Settlement Date""?

  


**Scenario 1:**

Monday: Sell $XYZ. Settlement date now that we're on T+1 is Tuesday.

Tuesday: This IS the settlement date. The funds are 100% real as of market open. I can buy $ABC and sell it one minute later since it was purchased with already settled funds (however inadvisable, I'm just drawing attention to the rule boundaries).

  
**Scenario 2:**

Monday: Sell $XYZ. Settlement date now that we're on T+1 is Tuesday.

Tuesday: This is the settlement date, but somehow ""T+1"" really means ""ADD TWO"" so the funds are not real yet. If I buy $ABC with the \*apparent\* funds I CANNOT sell it one minute later since it was purchased with still-settling funds.

Wednesday: Here, on literally fricking T+2, the funds are finally settled.



I've gotten both answers from the broker's communications. What's the actual rule? Scenario 2 seems bonkers: calling it T+1 when it's really up to between 24-48 hours from the funding sale moment.",investing,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d2rj12/interpreting_settlement_date/

I have recently starting looking into bonds and trying to figure them out. After doing research online I have the basic jist of whats going on but I have one main question. 

&#x200B;

How come I'm able to buy a 100$ bond on my brokerage (Public) that matures in 14$ at 5-6% interest, but then other bonds will be 6 - 12 months at same price and around 6-7% interest. I know some of them will payout semi-annually / quarterly percentages but is that the only advantage to buy into 'long-term' bonds. 

&#x200B;

Just for a little further information, most bonds on Public trade at the same price of around $80-$100 with most top 7 companies, there are $50 bonds for higher risk companies that pay +10% interest, but I understand the risk in that, just trying to figure out why I would not just buy 100$ bond and make $4.50-$6 every 2 weeks.

Acorns charges $9 a month for you to choose your ETFs. Is there any other broker where I can deposit my money straight into VOO?

The point is: I don't want to deposit the money into the broker, then wait for the money to be transferred, then have to remember to buy VOO a few days later.

Acorns buys the ETFs automatically as soon as the money is deposited.

He confirmed you keep the entirety of the deposits for the life of the insurance while you are paying into it. And can withdraw any amount at any time without penalty after the first year (first year % withdraw max I think I recall at 60%). Plus it obviously grows and the growth is tax deferred.  
  
This sounds too good to be true. I already invest into SPY similar ETF funds. And you are going to provide half a million in mortgage insurance for basically nothing if I die?

cheerful_saddness,Mom of three at the mercy of impulsive spender husband,1726798205,1fl1due,0,81,"
TL;DR: Husband is an impulsive spender with mental health issues. Looking for opinions on investing my small direct-deposits from my job without him noticing so we can have something to give our kids and retire with. 

Our finances have been a mess for so long now. We’ve been through Dave Ramsey stuff, Robert Kiyosaki, YNAB, you name it. My husband always turns around and spends money SO impulsively and gets extremely defensive when I bring it up. 

I’ve set up a bank account that he does not know about and I’m going to be making deposits every week from my job. We both work full time and make about the same amount of money. I handle the finances because he doesn’t want to look at them. He’s apathetic towards everything except trading cards. 

We are working on the mental health stuff but that takes time. I won’t leave him. I love him and I take my marriage commitment in sickness and health very seriously.

So I get paid weekly and I know he wouldn’t notice $60 a week gone. I’m so desperate to take care of my family, I want to make sure my three kids have a hand up when they are ready to leave the house. I refuse to leave them with nothing. I can’t do that. 

What can I do with $60 a week that would make a difference? I’m humbly asking for opinions. Thank you so much. ",investing,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fl1due/mom_of_three_at_the_mercy_of_impulsive_spender/

""A PENSION fund, or an annuity fund,  becomes edgy when it observes the real sages of the world are alarmed about the gap between equity market prices and the underlying threats to equity market values.

Be the cause geopolitics, threats of trade wars, real wars, civil wars or simply threats of tectonic change, alarm bells have sounded for sages.

The likes of George Soros, George Friedman, Neil Howe, Ray Dalio and John Mauldin are all flashing lights about the sustainability of asset values.

Even the lightest weights in our savings industry should pay attention to such people, who have had decades of success in spotting the signals of spiralling asset prices.

The pension funds sector and those running annuities are inured to gluttonous fees from their funds management contracts.  So their first response to the threat of lower returns is to switch attention to those sectors which are either opaque (like private equity) or have high short-term returns at the cost of hidden risk (private credit). They will want to protect their mandates and fees if the risk of falling asset prices converts to reality.

Most of a certain generation will recall these scary symptoms from the pre-1987 crash and the pre-2008 crash when alarm bells were deafening.",investing,0.1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1flwacd/broker_cautions_against_high_valuations/

One with UB Direct. Had to contact them to keep the promotional rate. It had gone down just a bit. That’s been ok. The other I have several hundred thousand with is US Bank and their 4.5% went down to 1.5% after a few months. My bank rep said the 4.5% was promotional for 3-6 months.

A project in which I make an index that tracks 7 stocks on their performance for next few days or weeks. And the stocks I choose I shall also study on them financially and do a stock pitch for all 7 of them. I plan on making a website with living pricing (through api) and see how the index performs. In the website I want to have different sections like news about the 7 stocks or any important dates regarding the current stocks and have a section where I give a market recap on those 7 stocks after market closes. I also have a section where how the index is weighed and how the stocks were chosen and why they were chosen. And how much the index has perform over the time period compared to different funds and gold or other financial instruments. And if the index keeps running well id like to keep for a long time and for the record i would be also investing my money in the index. Now im not confident enough of idea on how to weigh the index and what market cap or sectors to aim for. I’m comfortable with researching and studying financials of the stocks but just don’t know where to aim. Also let me know if the idea is studied for a freshman undergraduate to do as a project.

We've still got 6 more months in this year, and I'd like to diversity my portfolio, so I'd like to know what kind of any local companies that you feel are worthy of investing in.

So far, my two notable choices have been CAVA (chipotle alternative) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (bio tech research company).",stocks,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dsw5vw/underrated_local_stocks_in_your_area_for_taxable/

Secure_Maintenance55,About Graphite Electrodes - GrafTech International Ltd (EAF) ,1717224654,1d5h1i8,0,1,"Hi All

Recently I noticed that Biden has imposed tariffs on China

1. Biden to End Tariff Exemption on Synthetic Graphite from China
2. Biden hits Chinese electric cars and solar cells with higher tariffs

This made me want to look for some valuable stocks, I looked for Graphite stocks and I found

[**GrafTech International Ltd (EAF)** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrafTech)

I did some research .

Graftech makes graphite electrodes which are used by EAFs to convert electricity into heat to then melt steel.

In August 2015, GrafTech was acquired by Brookfield Asset Management

When graphite electrode prices were at their peak in 2018, Brookfield took GrafTech public again. GrafTech paid out substantial interest that year, and Brookfield, as the majority shareholder, recouped a significant amount of money as a result. However, GrafTech was left with a massive debt burden. About Graphite Electrodes - GrafTech International Ltd (EAF)

The company's stock price is currently at an all-time low  2024/05/31 1.65$

**BAD:**

1. They lost like 40% of their production when their mexican plant went down. Looks like an Indian producer is eating their lunch.
2. The suspension at the St. Mary facility affects 105 employees. Among them, 91 people were temporarily laid off and 14 were permanently laid off. The layoff dates are from February 13, 2024 to May 31, 2024.
3. Long term agreements rolling off and being replaced with lower spot rates. Prices falling from $9000+ to call it $3500
4. CEO turnover, board turnover, instability
5. Brookfield's stake in the company fell to 9.09% as it sold down its holdings to 23.3528 million shares . and looks set to continue selling

**GOOD:**

1. Things can't quite look any worse because of the above factors
2. Production ramping back up
3. Might build another needle coke facility
4. Graphite Electrode Growth of 65k Europe, 25k North America.
5. EAF is like 1/7 of total production capacity
6. They have a strong supply of an input Needle Coke for 1/3+ of their production which their competitors lack.
7. Mohnish Pabrai held stocks short-term in 2019 Q2\~Q4
8. New investors buy stocks in large quantities (Colonial House Capital Ltd , Undavia Nilesh)
9. Seadrift Coke LP got approval for a permit to expand its Texas facility that makes a material for electric vehicle batteries. This follows the company's plan from last year to potentially increase production.
10. The 2024 q1 financial report indicates that As of March 31, 2024, we had liquidity of $275 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $165 million and $110 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2024, we had gross debt( 8) of $950 million and net debt(9) of approximately $785 million. We continue to have adequate liquidity in 2024 to navigate the persistent challenges in the commercial environment.

**CONCLUSION:**

>Biden's China tariffs will help Graftech , I predict that St. Mary, the Mexican facility will return to utilization, and Bookfiled will completely sell its shares. It should be a slow and good growth process. and I checked all the factory’s Google Maps, Glassdoor, and Facebook employees’ reviews of the company. Most of them are very positive comments , I think Graftech has the potential and ability to develop better .  
I'm hoping someone can give me some ideas or what I've missed, would be very grateful

2 - Loan balance $180k, worth $450K, rents for $2600, cashflows $700/mo. APR 3.625%

I recently had a rough bout with Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) and it was a truly horrible experience. As the potency of cannabis products continues to increase, I believe the chances of developing CHS are also rising. This got me thinking about the investment potential in this area.

With new research on CHS, I think there's a significant opportunity for growth in stock prices of companies or institutions leading the charge in studying and addressing this condition.

Does anyone know which companies or researchers are currently focusing on CHS? Are there any biotech or pharmaceutical companies making strides in this area?

SherbetTiger,Why do MER (Expense ratio) and Management fees matter when we don't see them on our statements?,1717072502,1d42z93,0,1,"I'm confused with these fees because they do not show on our statements.

I spent days googling to understand these two fee measures and learnt that they apply to ETFs usually. What is even more confusing is that they exist for ADRs too. If you have a single holding ETF and compare them to ADR equivalent of that same holding, which one leaves you with more returns after the fees? You don't see the fees on your statements so have fun figuring that one out.

>The management fee and management expense ratio (MER) are phrases commonly used when discussing mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other investment funds. While they are related, each refers to different aspects of fund expenses. A management fee is charged by an investment manager for managing the fund's assets, while the MER, typically called the expense ratio, represents the total cost of managing and operating a fund and is given as a percentage of the fund's total assets.

However, I called different investing platform customer support and asked them if I don't see the fee, how does it affect my returns? They all told me it is just an indication of fees from the portfolio management team and does not charge fees out of my pocket. For example, if I bought a stock at 15$ and sold it for $15 after a week, I would break even, not charged with any fees that would leave me with a negative balance. 

TLDR: Talking with brokers' customer services left me more confused. If MER is baked into the stock price, buy something and sell something would already include the MER in the total price you sell and buy the stock, they cancel each other out. $15 stock bought and sold at that same price leaves you 0$.

What I don't understand is who is actually buying the shares? All I do is contribute and log in every once in a while to see where the value is at. Do I have an actual human broker at Fidelity who sees my contribution every two weeks and just buys a bunch of shares? Does a robot do it?

Therefore assuming I’m just investing in something like VOO or VTI Is there really any reason to use a tax advantaged retirement account assuming that I’ll pretty much never have a reason to sell more than $47k in a year from my regular account, thus it will be tax free anyways and be more available if I do need a few thousand dollars for something.

I've heard various explanations, and even parroted some, but they all seem to be a bit lacking as an actual holistic explanation. Here are some below.

1. ""All of the historical returns of the global stock market come from about 4% of listed companies."" While this is interesting, it's not really an explanation. It doesn't explain why identifying those companies is inherently difficult, just that they are relatively rare.
2.  ""Most hedge funds and other skilled investors don't beat the market"". While I agree this is true, it's simply an observation. There's no explanation.
3. Efficient-market hypothesis. The idea is that asset prices reflect all available information, so every stock is priced perfectly, and therefore alpha doesn't exist. The problem with this is that no one actually believes that markets are perfectly efficient, even EMH proponents will concede this. It's also assumed that smaller, lesser known stocks are priced less efficiently than larger, more known stocks. So even if you believed that the price of say, Apple, was nearly perfectly efficient, there would still be theoretical alpha with smaller stocks. 

It seems that most people conclude it's extremely difficult to beat the market based purely on observational data, or because someone they respect said so. Are there any research papers or detailed explanations explaining *why* it's actually so difficult?

**Input values:**

**Bond type**: In-state Municipal  
**Yield**: 5%  
**Estimated Taxable Income**: $100000  
**Federal Tax Filing Status**: Married Filing Jointly  
**Principal State of Residence**: Arizona  
**Local Income Tax**: 0%

**Output results:**

|In-State Municipal		|CDs|Corporate|Out-of-State Municipal	|Treasury and Agency/GSE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|5.00%	|6.73%	|6.62%	|5.13%	|6.41%|

From what I can see, to get an after-tax yield of 5% (which can be achieved through tax-free, in-state munis), I would need to buy a CD at 6.73%. Likewise, a T-Bill with a yield of 5.13% would also net me an after-tax yield of 5% (in the state of AZ).

Is my understanding of these results correct?

the risk with holding leaps is that if we trade sideways/down for extended periods of time id be gutted on my calls but I could also roll down and further and accumulate more shares & calls. so why not just be mostly in +700 DTE calls if we assume SP500 will be higher than it is now within 10 years? I could have a significantly larger delta in my portfolio with leaps instead of having a mere 100 delta with 100 shares I could have 5x 85 delta contracts or 425 delta. there exists a non-zero probability that actually even if I keep rolling spy continues to trade sideways/down for years and years but whats the actual odds of that happening

Here's my thoughts:

As a Chinese person witnessing China become more and more indoctrinated and is at the point of collapse, I want to ask for advice on how to make money if I can predict the end of China. The thought of my prediction comes from years of living in both USA and China, now in Canada.

Of course, I know country like this does not easily collapse, and it's deemed to put on quite a show for the world stage to see. Granted it has big millitary and population, but this is a weak nation at its core.

I remember hearing Andrew Huberman's conversation with Dr. Jamil Zaki, and thinking to myself that Chinese people do have the tone of cynical in their day to day society, and that there is nothing an individual can do except for letting history take its course.

Kind-Abbreviations42,Complications with Robinhood account investing,1727046910,1fn6giw,0,3,"Hello,

I have almost around 200k investment in Robinhood. Last year in September 2023, I moved to Canada and am planning on returning November of this year back to the US. I am not a US citizen but I am a resident for tax purposes until my move to Canada (lived in the US for 8 years on student visa). Robinhood sent me a notice saying that I might be accessing the account from outside of the US and wanted me to verify my current address by October 1st. I tried to chat with a customer agent and they told me they have to close my account and liquidate my account OR transfer my account to another brokerage. I chose Schwab to start the transfer but I am afraid Schwab also might have restrictions about my residency. What are my options here? Should I just not respond to Robinhood and let my account freeze by not responding by Oct 1st and re-open it when i get back to the US in November? Liquidating would mean i will be in a very big tax liability as I probably have to pay tax for the entire gain I made over the years. Is there an international brokrage that i can transfer my account to? ",investing,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fn6giw/complications_with_robinhood_account_investing/

My idea is a long term investment strategy that moves money into trackers of markets with a low CAPE compared to the historical average, and moves money out of markets with a high CAPE.

Squeeze-Finder,$TEM - SqueezeFinder Spotlight,1719856982,1dszll9,0,1,"Hey everyone, I wanted to bring a very special setup to your attention, TEM - Tempus AI. This is a recent IPO with a data profile that I haven't seen in a very long time, honestly since 2020 or so. It's a large cap, established company that provides AI models for hospitals and healthcare facilities. I don't claim to understand the ins and outs of the tech, but it definitely sounds like a great business model and something that will create a positive impact to society at large. Now, what makes the setup so special and why am I posting about it?

* Large Cap, established IPO's are pretty rare. And IPO's with options are also very rare
* AI is super hot right now, so this can bring lots of attention to the stock
* The limited short data that we have available is SUPER STRONG, and as the weeks go by we will get more accurate data
* Stock has been at or near ZERO BORROW for the last several sessions
* Borrow Fees are increasing daily and ranging from 80% to 300%+
* Float size is misreported, this one definitely moves fast like a low-float stock. Today less than 1M volume has dipped the price by about 20%. It can move back up just as quickly
* Float is mostly locked until December, with some special provisions to unlock some shares sooner

This ticker came onto my radar from my IPO Watchlist (similar to my main Watchlist but with a simpler scoring mechanism because IPO's don't have all the same data available for several weeks after they start trading)

!! MY TRADE PLAN - NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE - PLEASE TRADE YOUR OWN PLAN !!

DISCLOSURE: I have some shares from $31 and some August $55 calls with a cost basis around .70  
I'm hoping the company will schedule an earnings call before 8/16 so we can get a catalyst before these calls expire. If there is no catalyst before then, I will most likely roll out to Oct calls.

I don't have a Juice Target on these IPO's, but based on previous experience with IPO squeezes I would like to see a slow and steady rise to the $60-70 area and then a proper squeeze that can take the price up over $100. WE WILL NEED SOME KIND OF CATALYST to make this happen.

Perplexedstoner,What advice would you give a 20 year old who’s starting out investing to have a worry free retirement?,1720139438,1dvlf4t,0,2,"Little context: 
Im a 20 year old dude who’s pretty competent with money despite knowing how difficult it’s going to be to build wealth from nothing in 2024, I’m moved out of my moms with roommates ($200/month) and have a paid off used car that drives well enough. I am working in the electrical field through a private company as a first year apprentice ($17/HR).

I understand there’s no way of speedrunning the money game without egregious amounts of risk and luck which i’m intent to avoid. 


I’ve recently opened up a Webull account after doing a fair bit of research not only on what long term investments will help reach my goals, but even the brokerage platform I chose just based on UI comfort for myself.

I’ve started out with VOO and SCHD due to the consistency i’ve seen as well as avoiding buying Stocks over ETFs since my goal is to do this passively without thinking too much about it day-day.
I have a handful of different options I like including VTI,QQQ and SPY and would gladly hear recommendations.

I have an HYSA opened with my bank that doesn’t provide the highest % but I like keeping it with my bank and it still has a 2% rate. I’m keeping my emergency fund of about 3k as well as anything I don’t invest or spend to go towards a new car. 

The one thing i’m currently missing is a dedicated retirement account as i’m slightly curious how to go about putting money towards something like an IRA while investing simultaneously into basically identical ETFs through a brokerage account on my own?

Basically i’m just wondering if there’s anything wrong with my investment strategy here, I’m planning on putting about $500 a month into a mix of the stocks I mentioned and that will increase over the years as I continue to gain knowledge in my career and thus earn more. Does this generally fit my goal of achieving a comfortable retirement without actively pursuing an alternative income like social media/flipping etc.

Not sure if it makes sense to have both our portfolios invested in the same two ETFs. Of course it would be nice if we could combine our limits for our TFSA and RRSP, but thats not the world we live in lol.

July 5 Update: today SFTBY went up 6.36% and 61.96% year to date

SFTBY I think is a great investment long term as long as ARM keeps going up and it does. Not saying to drop a house in it, just a good idea to have it in your portfolio between 3% to 5% of your total investment. Way better investment than TSLA, which I think will drop like a rock after next earning report. On the news they always say ARM is a buy buy buy. SoftBank is barely mentioned. The institutions control the news, so yes they would rather you buy ARM, when SoftBank is a better investment.

workthrowaway6333,Reallocation strategy ,1720478147,1dymbpk,0,4,"TL/DR: I’m curious about this sub’s thoughts on my reallocation strategy for my TSLA position (small but profitable) after assuming too much risk in other accounts. 


Definitely gonna start offloading my $TSLA in one of my 2 individual accounts. I’ve been holding since December 11, 2017, with a few sells here and there - not much but enough that I’m only holding house money. Last year I also sold about 3 shares to buy $RIVN. 

The current balance is $3,015.55. Up 9.58X after today’s close. 

At this point I’m considering I’m considering selling $100 a day (until $TSLA hits $200 or I only have $1000 in it) and reallocating to:
QQQ -$30
FXAIX -$30
FDIG - $15
MSFT -$5
NFLX - $5
AAPL - $5
RIVN - $5
COIN - $5

I’m trying to reallocate all of my accounts (2 brokerage, a trad ira, a Roth IRA, and an HSA. 

I began investing around 2009 and took on way too much risk, which I’ve paid for over the past 3 years - a lot of pot stocks, EV infrastructure (BEEM, CHPT, BLNK), and too heavy in China (BABA, TCHEHY, BIDU, MCHI, NIO). From 2009 to 2018, you could basically throw darts and double your money, but that’s not the case anymore. My Trad IRA is down from $73,000 in 2021 to $29,000 now. 

I’m going to start being more risk averse and limiting my exposure, while keeping some - as seen above. 

My 401k is pretty conservative, consisting of 4 funds, and 10% bonds. 

Any thoughts on my strategy for the TSLA profits? ",stocks,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dymbpk/reallocation_strategy/

Nvidia  ([**NVDA**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/NVDA)) , which powered around a third of the [S&P 500](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/s/s-p-500)'s first-half advance, has been the prime beneficiary of an [AI](https://www.thestreet.com/tag/artificial-intelligence)-investment surge that has transformed the chip sector while adding nearly $2 trillion to its overall market value.

Demand for its market-leading processors and semiconductors, as well as the hype surrounding the launch of its new Blackwell system, has catapulted Nvidia into one of the world's biggest stocks, with a market value of $3.1 trillion. 

And in turn these factors have dragged rival chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices  ([**AMD**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/amd-1))  and Micron Technology  ([**MU**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/MU))  to outsized first-half gains. 

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector index, the market's industry benchmark, has risen more than 38% this year, more than double the advance of the S&P 500. The chip index hit a record 5,826.16 points early in Tuesday trading.

In mature companies, it’s easy for us to value invest. But, growth investing..? I tried finding some things online but no luck yet.

I am assuming that the investor really needs to know the market in which the growth is happening to truly evaluate the potential of the company. For example.

Anyhow, my backstory: I already have both my 401k and Roth IRA fully contributed and invested every year and have a joint MMA with my wife. Now, I do have extra cash stash in a HYSA that’s forecasted to make just about $500/year, and kind of want to generate 4x that — So, $2k/year. I’m looking at opening a taxable account where there’s a long-term investment towards retirement, and one where there’s a short-term, supplemental income-producing investment within that portfolio.

My questions and thoughts:

* Is it possible (advisable?) to approach in building both a long-term and short-term investment within the same portfolio (In this case, a taxable account)?
* Is building a supplemental, small, short-term passive income-producing portfolio worth it? I know dividend portfolios get a bad wrap as it takes more capital and more time to build a sustainable dividend portfolio.
* Or should I just stick with my HYSA and just keep adding to it slowly (Not ideal for me since I want to produce supplemental income like right now to get up to $2k/year)?

As NVIDIA approaches Apple, what happens next?",1716931276,1d2uyh1,0,123,"Exxon Mobil was America’s most valuable publicly traded company for much of the 2000s & early 2010s, as the oil booms during those periods delivered enormous profits. Since the mid-2010s, Apple (and eventually the rest of Big Tech) began to exceed Big Oil’s profits. For much of the past decade, Apple has been the most profitable and most valuable U.S. company, occasionally trading places with Microsoft, the 2nd most profitable U.S. company.

Which brings us to the current situation. Microsoft is worth $3.2 trillion; Apple is worth $2.9. Microsoft is actually making slightly less profit than Apple but has a shown a higher earnings growth trajectory in recent quarters/years. NVIDIA is worth $2.8 and making about a tenth of MS & Apple’s profits, but might double or triple its earnings this year. One of 3 things can happen:

1) NVIDIA takes #1 and grows into its valuation

2) NVIDIA takes #1 then loses it because it fails to grow into its valuation

3) Wall Street pumps Apple & MS stock higher so this never becomes an issue

Cruhoo,Beating the S&P with an S&P ETF?,1717082247,1d46ho6,0,1,"I'd like to hear flaws in/counterarguments to this strategy for trying to capitalize on market index gains:

The following is based on appreciation only and doesn't take into account dividends.  The S&P on May 14, 2004 had a value of $1,095.70.  On May 15, 2024, it's value was 484% of that, $5,308.15. Running the numbers on daily S&P closing values over that 20-year period, if you had bought 1 ""share"" of an S&P-targeted fund on May 15, 2004 for $1,095.7, held that until it had appreciated by at least 2.3% (over basis, which occurred on May 27, 2004, at $1,121.30), then sold at that price, waited until there was a daily drop in market value of at least 0.7% (which occurred on June 3, 2004, when it dropped from $1,125 to $1,116.60) and then bought again, then repeat that pattern over the twenty years, then that original $1,095.70 investment, rather than being worth the $5,308.15 it would have if you'd just held it for 20 years, would be worth $6,707.60 instead, so 612% instead of 484%.  Over the 20 years, that would have involved only 141 buy or sell transactions, and a total of 780 trading days of sitting out of the market waiting to buy back in.

Say a traditional IRA is invested in an S&P-targeted ETF, so no capital gains on trades, and no commissions on trades.  Granted, waiting for a daily drop to buy back into the market means periodically losing out on a growth streak, but over time that evens out without trying to predict the market.  Running this for different time periods over the 20 years, the maximal return from sell/buy percentages varies but is generally in the sell around 2% / buy at -0.5% range, and it generally does around 15-20% better than just holding for that time period.  2.3%/-0.7% appears to be the maximum combination for 20 years.

Educate me on the downsides I'm not considering in this proposal as a way to get the benefit of S&P-indexed appreciation over the long range, while minimizing the impact of drops in value.",investing,0.66,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d46ho6/beating_the_sp_with_an_sp_etf/

currently i’m working and living in California and my job pays me 93k salary. i take home approximately 4.4k monthly after taxes and deductions. 

i currently have 71k in a CD 5.25% APY that will end in 2 months and have 20k in a HYSA 5.3% APY. i have around 3.5k in my checking acc im living off to pay off credit card usage and daily expenses. i have no debt other than monthly spendings which i always pay off.

my company also has a 8% 401k match which i contribute 8% as well per paycheck. i have 31k in my 401k and recently created my ROTH IRA and maxed out for 2023 with 6.6k in it and planning on maxing out 2024 at 7k end of the next tax year. 

i was wondering what i should do in terms of investing my money, would it be safe to throw in the SnP500 such as VOO or FXAIX or should i wait for my CD to end and chuck in 100k into another CD? i was also planning on using this money as a down payment towards a condo / apartment within the 500k range.

There are some midrange condos available for sale where I’m at for about the amount of money, and I’m not too at risk of losing my income in the meantime. However it feels strange to hedge almost everything I own on a property, even if it saves me an exhorbanent amount over rent.

TLDR: I have a prototype of the Android application, which is navigation app, but also has feature to buy virtual areas with ability to resell them, and this could be used as investment.

  
As mentioned above, this is an application, which uses Augmented reality technology to navigate in the area, and registered users can buy virtual areas for a reason to exceptionally use them or to resell them later. 

  
The backstory of this application was simply just attempt to develop 'something', for fun, and I have chosen AR as a technology which I see could be perspective. After couple of years I started to think on how this application can make money. I have refused ideas to add ads or to make this app paid, so I was thinking about the other way.

  
My question would be: as the community interested in investments, would you be interested in new type of assets? I use word 'asset', because I cannot find any other word to describe this.  
I understand that this is something unusual, there is not much details, but long ago bitcoin was the same :)

fridaynighttrader,Ratio Covered Calls / Week 3,1709334912,1b48scm,0,1,"What's going on Thetagang? I figured I'd post my follow up to my post last week about my Ratio Covered Calls I'd began selling on my SPLG holdings. For those that haven't seen my post yet, this strategy is basically a way of capturing additional upside on bullish price action without creating additional downside risk.  
  
Performance / Week 3:  
  
With the continued bullish price action over the past several months, we saw the S&P500 close at an all-time high this week. While I'm not the type to forecast the future I do incorporate bullish sentiment into my strategy.  
  
My position has returned 2.7% ($4117) so far in this monthly expiration cycle and with less than 2 weeks until expiration we are potentially facing our shares being called away + remaining debit spreads being closed for max profit. In the same time frame, the S&P is up 2.5%, meaning I have a small bit of alpha.  
  
The beauty of the strategy is you can always have additional upside without creating additional downside especially for those of you who are long broad market indices and are risk averse with your strategies. If I asked you whether you'd be happy making 3% gain on your portfolio when the underlying has only increased 1.5% in that same timeframe, you'd probably say yes!  
  
Additional considerations: If you don't want taxable events in your everyday trading then this might not be suitable for you. I am transitioning my SPLG options into XSP options over the next year to receive better tax treatment on the capital gains as a way to maximize returns. Happy trading!  
  
Positions:  
  
SPLG - 2700 shares @ 57.73/share  
  
SPLG - Long +27 of the March 15 57 strike calls @ 1.61 debit/contract  
  
SPLG - Short -54 of the Match 15 58 strike calls @ .90 credit/contract",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b48scm/ratio_covered_calls_week_3/

I'm 40 and married with a toddler, no credit card debt but owe 220k on a mortgage (3% rate, house is worth 800k plus), and have a car loan of 40k. The only stocks we have are my wife's 401k with about 25k value currently and a Roth IRA I started last year. I previously had a small 401k built up with a company I left and we cashed it out to do a home remodel. We save enough that I can max out the Roth IRA but nothing more that that each year. 

Here's the question: My beloved Grandpa left me his coin collection that if sold would be worth at least 70k, if not closer to 100k if I took my time selling. I love coin collecting and would love to teach my son about it and pass down the collection. I also know how much that money would compound in my fidelity account that would be nice to see grow. 

I don't discuss finances with my family but I have a feeling there will be large stock portfolios passed down to me from my parents but that's not a known factor and 30 years away. It's enough to make me consider keeping all the gold so I don't regret losing it, when we are getting by just fine but done have a retirement funded.

HK_Ootoot,Dad Passed Away- Left Behind a Hefty Sum in Municipal Bonds and a high margin balance- What to do next?,1726808217,1fl4abb,0,77,"Dad passed away nearly 2 years ago  and one of the investment accounts he left behind is a Morgan Stanley account with a high six figure balance. I recently called Morgan Stanley to get an idea of the asset mix in the account and he told me that it’s all in municipal bonds, that is getting around 3% interest tax free. However, there’s also a margin balance on the account, from when my dad borrowed money from this account a few years ago. The Morgan Stanley account rep was surprisingly helpful in giving me a surface level understanding of what is happening in the account, but I’d like to get a more detailed understanding of how to address the margin balance. Morgan Stanley said it’s best we sell off however many municipal bonds shares we need to in order to pay off the margin balance, but that just seems like an easy way for them to get that balance paid off. The martin balance is roughly 40% of the total account balance. How do these margin balances work?  I’d prefer to just sell off all the municipal bonds and then reinvest all the money in stocks since I’m way more knowledgeable in that investment pool and have had my own success in stocks over the past 3-4 years. If that margin balance wasn’t in the picture, I’d already have sold off all the municipal bonds, but with that margin balance I want to make sure I make the most informed decision. Thanks all!

jeanc0re,Starting investor advice 3 stock portfolio? Or all in on dividents?,1726917869,1fm0tds,0,1,"Hey all, beginning investor here. 

I am currently looking for a strategy that works well in my circumstance. I'm currently under a special tax regime that gives me 0% on capital gains and 0% on dividents. This for 9 years. My goal in these 9 years is to grow my portfolio as much as possible by investing almost my entire income into it. 

I've been doing my due dilligence and looked into stocks vs etfs vs reits vs mutual funds, however most of the advice found is related to the US where they have 401ks and roth ira's.. That’s not a thing where I live and again, I dont have to worry about the taxes on my portfolio for a while. 

As it currently stands I am using ""professor G"" 3 stock portfolio strategy which is VOO, QQQM and SCHD. However I am unsure if that's the optimal strategy for my situation.

I invest about 20.000 USD/month in my portfolio and started 5 months ago. 

Any advice would be appreciated ",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fm0tds/starting_investor_advice_3_stock_portfolio_or_all/

Physioweng,What truly affects the prices of S&P500 ETFs?,1720674689,1e0h07h,0,19,"This is a genuine question out of curiosity. VOO/VTI/SPY (just to name a few) tracks the movement of S&P500. It’s been long known that the ETFs move in direct synergy with the index itself. 

I noticed VOO has level 2 market data on Moomoo showing the bid & ask. So it seems on first glance that people trading the ETF affects the price of the ETF itself. Meaning, more people buying VOO than selling = price increase and vice versa, rather than based on the prices of the 500 companies. But this can’t be true, since it moves in perfect synergy (minus management costs) with the S&P500 index itself. 

Does the price of VOO gets affected by:

1) All the cumulative movements of the 500 companies it tracks based on weightage? Ppl trading on the ETF has no direct effect on its price.

2) The supply & demand of the ETF itself (behaving just like any other stock). The tracked companies market cap increasing have no direct effect on its price. 

3) Or because buying VOO theoretically means you’re buying all 500 companies, so both 1) and 2) are true at the same time?

Which statement above is correct? Would appreciate if someone can shed some insight!


PS: if my assumption on 3) is correct, does that mean a stock’s price can be (marginally) influenced by the demand on all the ETFs that contains it?

#2 do I go all in and buy another 500 shares now or use the 175k in cash to buy something else

I was talking to my girlfriend and between conversations and jokes the idea of ​​“what our life would be like if we had 37 million” came up. Don't focus on the number, the number came from other ideas that aren't worth explaining here. However, where I want to get to is the following… She said she had to end her contract because she wasn't going to leave her job because it looked bad on her CV and then to find another job it wouldn't look good...... 🤣 I said it's not right in the head because whoever would earn 37 million from one day to the next would want to know about working for something. And I told him that with 37 million you only work if you're crazy in the head. Then I said that we had money to buy basically everything and anything, to live life seriously, to never worry about money or work again. She disagreed and said that afterwards she had nothing to entertain herself while our children were studying. 🤣 I said that I agreed with them studying but there was no point in “entertaining” yourself by working when there are infinite things for someone to entertain themselves in this world. Then he went on to say that we had to teach our children what it means to be responsible and that we have to work to get what we want. All good. I said that being responsible is different from continuing to work when you have 37 million in your account, because continuing to work is simply stupid and masochistic. Am I the abnormal one?

Puginator,GM's 2025 EV production capacity target in doubt after Barra comments ,1721086464,1e49qxq,0,39,"General Motors’ goal of being capable of producing 1 million all-electric vehicles in North America by the end of 2025 in heavily in doubt, following comments Monday by CEO Mary Barra.

The production capacity target for next year was one of the last EV targets the automaker hadn’t lowered or withdrawn as demand for EVs has not materialized as quickly as many companies such as GM previously expected.

“We won’t get to a million just because the market is not developing, but it will get there,” Barra said Monday at a virtual CNBC CEO Council event. “We’re going to be guided by the customer.”

For more than two years, GM has said it would have production capacity of 1 million in EVs in each China and North America by 2025. Even after it changed or withdrew several EV targets and product plans in the last year, the company continued to say it would install the North American capacity for EVs.

A GM spokesman said the company’s target was about the production capacity, while the question was regarding actually producing 1 million EVs in 2025. Barra did not specifcally address whether it was production or production capacity that she was referring to.

The spokesman later said the company would no longer reiterate the EV production capacity plans for 2025. The company has continually said its EV plans will be flexible to meet demand.

More details about the automaker’s EV plans could come when GM reports second-quarter results on July 23.

Organic-Maybe-5184,Friendly reminder about the hidden costs of US-domiciled funds for non-US persons,1717352106,1d6jibe,0,2,"I am currently in the process of calculating expected returns and expenses and considering US domiciled and Irish domiciled ETFs. I made this post just in case someone is in the same process as I am and to hear feedback on my calculations. Also, I learned about those tax issues randomly from random comment here, because this sub is pretty US-centric, and it's not talked about enough.

First off, it's better to start [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investing_start-up_kit_for_non-US_investors).

Let's compare hypothetical performance of two FTSE Global All Cap Index ETFs: US domiciled VT and Irish domiciled FWRA with the lowest TERs in their category: 0.07% and 0.15% accordingly.

US-domiciled mostly deemed unfit for non-US persons due to withholding tax of 30% on dividend yield. Capital gains (i.e. buying low, selling high) aren't taxed. I don't take US estate tax of 40% upon death seriously, mainly because the US has no idea if I die and pass on my account details to someone else to transfer the funds, and I would be too dead to care and feel guilty about it.

Irish domiciled ETFs also incur a 15% withholding tax on dividends.

FTSE Global All Cap Index has a historical dividend return of 1.53%. I didn't find the exact historic returns info on the index, but let's just say it's 7%. It includes dividends, so clear of dividends is 5.47%.

Tax-adjusted expenses of VT: 0.07+0.0153\*0.3=0.529%

Tax-adjusted expenses of FWRA: 0.15+0.0153\*0.15=0.3795%

VT is more expensive by 0.1495%. Let's say we invest $10000 and see what happens in 20 years.

I used the formula for compound interest: initial\_sum\*((1-expense\_ratio)\*(1+expected\_return))\^years

VT: 10000\*((1-0.00529)\*(1+0.0547))\^20=$25215

FWRA: 10000\*((1-0.003795)\*(1+0.0547))\^20=$25984

VT is more expensive by $768 over the course of 20 years.

Is it a lot or not? Honestly, I don't know. The absolute number doesn't seem big, but it's 7.7% of initial sum and 5.5% of VT's gains, on top of unavoidable expenses. The absolute number will grow significantly if you invest more over time.

It's easy to say that US domiciled fund have no sense at all, but there is a chance that you may want to move to the US one day. Then you'll have two choices: to sell at market price (possibly at a loss), or pay horrendous US offshore taxes, which would destroy all your gains.

As for me, I don't really know. Probably I'm going to stick to the Irish domiciled ETF, because the US seems less and less attractive each passing year and probably it's unwise to pay today for possible event that may never come at all, but if you do intend to move to the US, this is a thing to consider.",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d6jibe/friendly_reminder_about_the_hidden_costs_of/

LostMyTurban,RobinHood Gold Benefits for Direct Deposits and IRA Match,1717359442,1d6mb8a,0,3,"Looking for some folks that use Robinhood Gold for their input. 



Sorry if this is the wrong place to write this, but with the Robinhood Gold Card coming out theres been quite a  buzz around them. The card caught my eye, but im way more interested in the gold features than the card per say. 

With gold, they say 1% added to direct deposits. Is there any problem with linking my work direct deposit to the account? Also, I understand the 1% is distributed over 24months. Lets say each work direct deposit is $1500 after taxes. 1% will be $15/24 =  $0.625 cents every month for 24months. Lets say another check hits 2 weeks later, does that compound ontop and now I get $1.25 every month for 24 months (assuming same month for both checks to hit) and so on?

  
I currently max out 401K and Roth IRA. Just opened a traditional as well. This one is straight forward but I assume transfering money to their just yields 3% ontop? So essentially $7000 max for this year + $210 from RH?

momchilandonov,Risks of investing in ETP (Exchange Traded Products) compared to CFDs and futures?,1709456226,1b5cq85,0,1,"Hello Everyone,

&#x200B;

Why are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs?

Example is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$

We all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia. The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices.

This ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25%

The NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$. 

For some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions.

I am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc.

Please try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell. 

Another example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends.

shikachan,Roth IRA: I contributed when I wasn’t supposed to?,1709558769,1b6au8g,0,1,"For 2023 year I contributed the maximum by end of December. I did this thinking I was not going to reach the income limit. With those contributions I also made some investments, although not utilizing all of it. However, in January after receiving my tax documents, I am over the limit.

Is there a way to redistribute these funds into a traditional IRA so as to not incur a penalty? ",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b6au8g/roth_ira_i_contributed_when_i_wasnt_supposed_to/

rfcity2,Compound Interest & Retirement Math,1709642518,1b74a1d,0,5,"I'm trying to combine these two financial ""rules/math"" and want to see if this is a reasonable expectation.

1. At 7% annual gains, your balance will double every ten years.
2. If you withdraw 4% a year, your balance will stay stable, as long as you earn 4%+ in annual gains.

Therefore, if someone has $300,000 saved and plans to retire in 20 years, is it safe to assume that in the first 10 years, the balance will double to $600,000 and in the last ten years it will double again to $1,200,000? And by withdrawing 4%, that provides an annual income of $50,000?

The key factor being that there are no new contributions being added, only the $300,000 original balance is the principle. 

Of course there are market down times, inflation, taxes, diversification needs, etc that would need to be added as a buffer, but I'm just gut checking that a $50,000 annual income can be derived from a $300,000 principle 20 years prior.",investing,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b74a1d/compound_interest_retirement_math/

I've mostly dumping everything on VTI and I know people recommend 20% on VXUS. I work abroad and I will always claim the foreign income exclusion (work in a tax-free countr). I was wondering how this all works if I invest in VXUS because I don't want to claim the FTC.
