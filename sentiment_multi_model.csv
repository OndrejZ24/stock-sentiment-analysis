m49qgyp,"Eh, how many of these companies are operating profitably right now (and I’m talking for real, not the bioasset masturbated balance sheets)? I would venture to say very few, if any. I’m too lazy to look at all the numbers tbh, but that should tell you about the long term viability of their model. If their tenants can’t pay, they get up shits creek fast. Their model relies on companies to pay an above market cap rate essentially on real estate, which is fine…. Until these companies run out of money and the music stops like w IIPR. Cannabis industry really can’t catch a break. Really an atrocity how it’s all been rolled out. There’s a million other factors to consider here.. but I think of it like this…. New lake owns a shopping plaza essentially. Do they have quality tenants? Eh, at best. How long can those tenants continue to pay rent in a declining market when they’re already operating unprofitably? There’s zero money flowing into the cannabis space at the moment, even at 99% discounts in some equities v aths (that should tell you something 😬). Raising more capital now is not even a consideration for most companies, the dilution at these valuations would be ridiculous. Side note: I am ALWAYS wrong lol.

Meanwhile, AST's technology (patent protected) somehow threads the needle and doesn't interfere with ground based communication. Both AT&T and Verizon have dumped a lot of money into AST, and if the FCC somehow decides to grant Starlink's waiver, they'll be going to war to protect their investment. Starlink has a car, while AST has a scooter.

m3zokjo,">long-term OTM calls ... have a huge advantage where money can be quickly multiplied in the event of unexpected stock moves If you correctly predict a large move in a stock’s price, the shorter the time frame you predict it in, the more money you stand to make. For example, if SPY is trading at $600, predicting it will drop to $580 in 3 days will yield far greater returns than predicting it will drop to $580 sometime within 6 months—assuming you’re correct. This is because short-dated options are cheaper upfront and react more dramatically to immediate price changes, maximizing your leverage. Leverage is a core advantage of options compared to regular shares, as price movements can generate much larger returns if your prediction is accurate. However, short-dated options are especially attractive for those chasing quick, high-risk payouts, partly because their lower premium costs make them accessible. Longer-dated options (e.g., LEAPs) are less tempting in this regard because their higher premiums eat into your profits. Even if the stock makes a significant price move early in the life of a LEAP, the contract’s value is constrained by the fact that there’s still ample time left until expiration, during which the price could swing back. That said, LEAPs are undeniably a smarter choice for those looking to hedge risks or invest with a longer horizon, compared to the sub-30 DTE options many gamblers chase. Personally, I think the sweet spot for DTE is somewhere between 90 and 360 days. The downside of LEAPs is their cost, particularly for high-priced stocks.

It is a traditional IRA on Robinhood. I have basic understanding of investing and i have been doing it for 15 years. I have always invested in VOO mainly, but last year i bought some IBIT and QQQ. I am not looking to retire soon, and i have bought couple propreties for 400k that i rent out at a low ROI of 4% - I consider these safe investement, that's why i am open to take higher risk in stock market. I know i shoudnt time the market, but my gut feeling is telling me a correction/crash is coming soon based on what i have been reading and seeing. Is there a stock market crash proof bond with low return that i can purchase ? can you suggest what new allocation should look like ? I am leaning to replace 50k of QQQ with Bond.

Combustion Engine (ICE) 2. Electric (BEV) 3. Hybrid (PHEV) 2. Motorcycles (\~2% of revenue) 3. Financial Services (\~23% of revenue) **Current headwinds:** 1. Car sales globally have slowed. 2. China, responsible for 32% of all auto deliveries, is experiencing structural growth challenges. 3. Europe, responsible for 37% of all auto deliveries, is growing slowly. 4. BMW recently had to recall vehicles due to faulty break systems, hammering their short term margins and delaying deliveries. 5. High rates have killed revenue generation in financing (demand for finances vehicles has fallen). **Some positive news:** 1. BMW EV sales are growing rapidly, notching \~22% growth for the first 9 months this year (source BMW Electric Car Sales Are Way Up In 2024 and Mini (3) are seen as pretty reliable. (source: Who Makes the Most Reliable New Cars? - Consumer Reports, 80% are looking to spend the same or more on their next car. Only 16% of Chinese consumers whose current car cost more than 300k RMB were more likely to buy a car because of price cuts. Conversely, 12% of these consumers seemed more hesitant to buy **because** of price cuts. These trends seems to support BMW’s decision to hike prices (source: BMW raises prices after China’s brutal discount war fails to boost deliveries | South China Morning Post: “Among respondents who purchased three major premium German brands, the appearance rate of these three brands in their \[initial consideration set (“ICS”)\] is nearly 100 percent for ICE vehicle owners and nearly 90 percent for EV owners. In contrast, few premium Chinese EV brands were in these consumers’ ICS: almost zero for ICE vehicle buyers and less than one-third for EV buyers.” It should be noted that consumers who currently drive a Chinese brand are unlikely to consider switching to a German brand. Chinese consumers perceive German car brands as the most premium overall. However, German card brands are not considered as premium in the EV space specifically. Chinese consumers are primarily concerned with the technological advantages of EVs (smart cockpit, autonomous driving), however, they trust multinational over domestic companies to deliver on quality and financial longevity. Consumers largely trust German brands to deliver on quality, a good driving experience, and safety, whereas domestic companies are trusted to deliver on energy efficiency and advanced technological features. Importantly, consumers seem less willing to pay a premium for a foreign vehicle, although this increase isn’t extremely pronounced. Generally, EV buyers are less concerned with branding than ICE buyers. Two thirds of consumers reported a willingness to reconsider purchasing a foreign vehicle if their tech features are improved upon. **Valuation** I approach valuation not from the perspective of w",post,ValueInvesting,2024-11-13 17:52:45,0.08968609571456909,ICE,1,4049,565,17,2,2024-11-13,negative,-0.8959253244102001,0.03596260026097298,0.03214948624372482,0.9318879246711731,negative,-0.9999587160928058,1.6726793546695262e-05,7.799227205396164e-06,0.9999754428863525,negative,-0.9969506674678996,0.0012249535648152232,0.0005994312814436853,0.9981756210327148,negative,-0.5801747404038906,0.020187560468912125,0.3794501721858978,0.6003623008728027,-0.868252362093699,0.039221442150585296,0.19804404093682115,2024-11-13

Previously, we used PAI, but they sold the business to Ascensus and we transitioned over. Ascensus has recently updated its fee structure and is now going to impose a 0.025% annual fee on all funds in the accounts for their ""Investment Fiduciary"" - which is going to cost us a ton of money each year. Not to mention, we already have our own fidicuary who we pay.

There's an inflation adjusted trendline that oil never goes below in the last 130 years (since 1890!!!!) and that price is now about $60/bbl. It only makes sense that the dance between money supply and the ""cost of doing business"" -- oil being the most free-energy we have ever had being that it's such an energy dense and readily available fuel -- means there's a floor at which oil cannot go below that is determined by money supply. That floor is easily determined by a 135 year trendline going back to 1890. As mentioned, it now sits about $60 per barrel. So unless you believe Trump will shut down the US and the global economy and everyone will start mask-breathing again, it's HIGHLY unlikely that the price of oil will go any lower than \~$66/bbl now (WTI).

1grh1ig,"META going to join the $3Trillion club?. This stock has been on a wild ride, and I think it’s time we dive into whether it’s a solid investment or just a temporary spike. **Numbers** Revenue hit $39 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and net income soared to $13.5 billion, a 73% increase. Mark Zuckerberg is clearly doing something right, and the market is responding positively. **Cash Flow** META generated $78.4 billion in operating cash flow over the last 12 months. That’s a solid foundation for any company. Plus, they have $70 billion in total cash ([balance sheet]( , which means they’re not going anywhere anytime soon. They’re buying back shares and paying dividends, which is always a good sign for investors. **Reality Labs** This use to be the most hated aspect of Meta that they were investing tons of money into technology without proving any commercial viability. But just the other day Meta revealed Orion, their new VR glasses. And it looks like it's a winner. **Valuation Perspective** Currently, META is trading at about 24 times its operating income, which is around it's 5 year average. So, on the surface, it looks like a decent buy. But maybe not a safe margin of error. But if their investments in Reality Labs pays off AND they continue to buy back stocks, we could be looking at a big rise in price.",post,ValueInvesting,2024-11-14 22:23:38,0.0520179383456707,META,1,1404,229,22,3,2024-11-14,positive,0.8884766837581992,0.8984003067016602,0.09167604893445969,0.009923622943460941,positive,0.9999999945960552,1.0,3.050834962436966e-08,5.403944847159892e-09,positive,0.9994338303513359,0.9996522665023804,0.00012924485781695694,0.00021843615104444325,positive,0.7309571364894509,0.7456729412078857,0.23961129784584045,0.01471580471843481,0.9047169112987603,0.016168788349934165,0.12715655055849134,2024-11-14
1grgyze,"Do you think TSLA will continue to slide?. I think everyone knows Tesla has experienced quite a run up to like $360 after Election Day. I think the most common consensus is that it’s an unwarranted “hype” run with speculation that somehow Trump will benefit Elon and Tesla. Yet right now it’s fallen about $50 from its height of $360. For those of us who are looking for a short term trade, do you think it will give a bounce up to $330 or so, or do you think it will continue to fall back to the mid $200s in the next week. I guess a lot of downward movement today may be attributed to the EV credits ending, but I’ve read that won’t affect Tesla as much as the other EV startups.

1gqij3x,HOW DOES SHORT WORKS? SPECIFICALLY AMC. Upon checking yahoo finance and scrolling down to statistics -> shorts this is the information I was able to get. Shares Short (10/31/2024) ^(4)48.61M Short Ratio (10/31/2024) ^(4)7.24 Short % of Float (10/31/2024) ^(4)13.35% Short % of Shares Outstanding (10/31/2024) ^(4) 13.32% Shares Short (prior month 9/30/2024) ^(4)57.18M In any case to the blind eye this does mean anything so of course I looked it up before writing this. Many people say that the reason we are not yet lost at least the APES is because we are holding enough for the stock not to crash if I am wrong please correct me. Secondly it seems that during 9/30/2024 they were 57m shorted stocks or shares is this term the same? Then a month later they were less meaning about 9m were recouped or purchased back correct? The ratio sees is that in 7.24 days they could technically recouped every last short but if they do this is that when AMC will go crazy like everyone wants it? The float does this mean how many stocks are available to trade meaning if I theoretically had enough money all I could buy is 13.35% more? does this mean about 86% of people purchased this much of the stock? Does this include both shorted and just purchased normally like me and you? Lastly the outstanding is 13.32% which I understand as being shorted currently? Is this high or low and why? To me 13% seems low in the aspect of 13/100% but in this case why is it high or not high enough. Just some insight if possible please.,post,stocks,2024-11-13 17:36:50,0.011073613539338112,AMC,1,1544,273,17,2,2024-11-13,neutral,-0.07633594051003456,0.03130863979458809,0.8610467910766602,0.10764458030462265,neutral,-3.5422182008915115e-05,6.44917872705264e-06,0.9999517202377319,4.1871360735967755e-05,neutral,-8.320261622429825e-05,5.877123840036802e-05,0.9997993111610413,0.00014197385462466627,neutral,0.021205253899097443,0.07442476600408554,0.8723557591438293,0.0532195121049881,-0.013812327852292583,0.0018379083936953926,0.04287083383485085,2024-11-13

1gqi2n6,"NICE Ltd., an undervalued AI stock that is positioned well whether or not generative AI even works. There may be literally only one stock that has not been swept up by AI hysteria, despite pivoting their business model to adapt to the prospect of generative AI - NICE Ltd. NICE Ltd., headquartered in Ra'anana, Israel, provides advanced cloud-based software for customer experience (CX) and financial crime prevention. NICE specializes in AI-driven platforms like CXone, which supports customer engagement through AI-based customer routing, automated interactions, and real-time analytics. Their Enlighten AI suite enhances contact center operations by helping agents offer more responsive, personalized service. They also offer solutions for digital evidence management and fraud detection, serving sectors like public safety, law enforcement, and financial compliance. NICE has been quietly rising ahead of their **earnings call tomorrow**, currently trading around $200. However, it is still WELL off of their high of $250. Their stock price the last several months has seen a sharp decline due to their longtime CEO, Barak Eilam, announcing his departure that will take place at the end of 2024. NICE, in my opinion, has taken an unfair beating for this news. Their replacement, Scott Russell, is an interesting hire due to his experience in the APAC market at a company the size of SAP and his international experience. NICE has not penetrated the European and APAC market well at all, and this could be an incredible opportunity to grow revenue in those markets with his appointment. They are already well entrenched in some of the largest F500 companies in the Americas. It's about time they start looking abroad. To speak on the tech itself, and whether or not generative AI will work in this industry, that itself represents an interesting scenario for NICE. In my opinion, whether or not AI works, NICE is positioned well. Their last earnings call, analysts asked Barak specifically about whether or not their generative AI systems are being used by their customers. He mentioned their proprietary ""co-pilot"", internally-faced AI used by customer service agents is being heavily utilized, and bookings is up 100% YOY for the technology, but that there is definitely still some hesitancy to roll out a generative AI customer service platform to the end consumer. This is fine, in my opinion, because if conceptually it doesn't work, NICE's technology is needed, and will serve the market as it has for years. If generative AI is the solution this industry will need, then they are even better positioned for that against the market with their technology. Some of the risks that I've heard. One is valid the other isn't. It is an Israeli based company, so there are going to be risks endemic there that are inevitable, which is valid. I also hear about how large companies like Microsoft and Amazon will enter this market and take away market share. This is really unlikely. Microsoft, for example, tried to do a CRM tool and it is truly dogshit and has close to zero market share. And CX software requires much more domain expertise than doing a CRM tool, which they failed spectacularly at.

m3y9lgq,I don't see anything in your post history that would make selling an issue. It's irregardless of my point though. Selling now is meaningless to my overall point though that selling at a loss is absolutely a wise choice in many situations. OP should have sold a long time ago when they started trending into bankruptcy and could have gotten vastly more capital back than selling the shares for pennies currently or holding them into bankruptcy cancellation and getting nothing.,comment,investing,2024-12-26 23:39:09,0.018076177686452866,OP,1,479,80,23,3,2024-12-26,neutral,-0.10943683236837387,0.06950315088033676,0.7515568733215332,0.17893998324871063,neutral,-0.21309088170528412,0.1740548461675644,0.4387994408607483,0.3871457278728485,neutral,-0.019871346652507782,0.050837308168411255,0.8784540295600891,0.07070865482091904,negative,-0.5168530698865652,0.022370362654328346,0.43840619921684265,0.5392234325408936,-0.21481303265318274,0.04677918480769344,0.21628496204704903,2024-12-26

I have no shortage of hobbies nor interests nor personal development angles (that I DO still engage in, even while working).

m3xgpsk,"Less than 25% will likely mean the person will never buy a home.m, except in this example with 500k in potentially liquid assets. A 500k house at about 7% interest and a 20% down-payment will run you about 3.6k in monthly mortgage payments. For that to be 25% of your income, you need to make at least 14.4k per month or 172.8k per year... which I assume is post-tax, not pre-tax. If post-tax, annual income would need to be 230.4k. With the average American income sitting around 63k per year (pre-tax), 25% of the average income would be between 11.8k and 15.75k per year (or 985 and 1,315 per month). This would afford a $100k house with 20% down at about 7% interest. Though OP is in a position to afford this with enough downpayment, __and your advice does apply to OP__... I don't think the majority of Americans can follow the 25% of your income advice. This would leave them renting forever and in a worse place financially.",comment,investing,2024-12-26 20:50:11,0.025500323623418808,OP,1,936,169,20,3,2024-12-26,negative,-0.5523913912475109,0.03574295714497566,0.3761226534843445,0.5881343483924866,neutral,-7.090854705893435e-05,9.419854904990643e-07,0.9999271631240845,7.185053254943341e-05,neutral,-0.007090751721989363,0.00013171631144359708,0.9926458597183228,0.0072224680334329605,neutral,-0.32813069969415665,0.04333745688199997,0.5851944088935852,0.3714681565761566,-0.22192093780267896,0.07195355948442014,0.26824160654980456,2024-12-26

m4868fc,"AMD processors are very good and used on most supercomputers. While gpu programming can offer advantages compared to cpu, it’s not an entire replacement (at least in the foreseeable future). Cpu programming is still the default in most computational stuff. AMD is also practically equivalent within the consumer PC world to Nvidia GPUs and intel CPUs. They just seem solid all around even if they don’t have “the best AI machine learning GPU” at the moment.

An AV company may have unprofitable days, weeks, or quarters depending on how many riders they obtain. But UBER will always make a profit on each ride. I own UBER shares and will hold long-term.

m49qe5r,"You got cute answers for lulz but here’s the gist: on the other side of every trade there is someone who, models have shown, you have to assume knows more about the transaction than the average investor. People here think they “know” but there are entire billion dollar companies doing nothing but research on prices, valuations, etc. Because of the amount of sophistication in information out there, it’s generally the most rational approach to assume that all information on future expected cash flows is already reflected on the price. Are there anomalies? (Example: GME’s much hyped but ultimately small squeeze). Sure. But these are far and away the exception. However, as always, you’ll see all sort of armchair experts on Reddit thinking that because they know a little, they know it all. When in fact, they are in the Dunning Kruger zone.",comment,stocks,2024-12-28 23:33:39,0.011073613539338112,GME,1,850,142,23,5,2024-12-28,neutral,-0.01527366042137146,0.03669259697198868,0.91134113073349,0.05196625739336014,neutral,-2.7983992140434566e-05,1.6207843600568594e-06,0.9999687671661377,2.9604776500491425e-05,neutral,-6.80010998621583e-06,7.475075108231977e-05,0.9998437166213989,8.15508610685356e-05,neutral,-0.01041671633720398,0.14361512660980225,0.7023530006408691,0.15403184294700623,-0.0064312902151755225,5.878251197840119e-05,0.007666975412664448,2024-12-28

It is possible to be right without following the crowd, and its not so strange to consider that there are solutions out there we may not see ourselves. To the OP: OTM calls are expensive, especially on something like the S&P500 where the constant growth is built into the premium. Its not a bad idea especially since things literally just never stop going up, the hard part is what I just mentioned. Things literally never stop going up. We haven't had an honest to god correction in any sense at all since 2022, and with the upcoming administration change, chinese economic struggles, inflation issues here, etc etc its a consideration that after multiple years of 20-30%+ growth we may not have such wildly bullish performance going forward.

m3z0xlb,"Same here, you have to look after your mental health and push back on the feelings of burnout. I worked in healthcare/biotech/pharma during COVID which was a burnout on it's own, then the industry pivot (panic) post-COVID that came in 2022 shoved me to the point of apathy, so I took a year off. It was one of the best choices I've ever made, I came back rejuvenated and ready to roll. To anyone considering it, if you can afford to take the break, especially when you're young enough to actually enjoy it and recharge, you will never regret doing it. If some interviewer or recruiter gives you grief over it, tell 'em to fuck off. Everyone I interviewed with could tell I was excited to get back into work because I had major time off, smart recruiters know that you aren't job-jumping or salary-leveraging, you just want to get back out there and contribute.",comment,financialindependence,2024-12-27 02:31:08,0.04645849019289017,TFSA,1,864,155,2,4,2024-12-27,neutral,-0.05379907786846161,0.07242099940776825,0.8013589382171631,0.12622007727622986,neutral,0.41320537123829126,0.42796483635902405,0.5572757124900818,0.014759465120732784,neutral,-0.23880670964717865,0.05874837934970856,0.6436965465545654,0.2975550889968872,neutral,-0.0356169193983078,0.22573427855968475,0.5129144787788391,0.26135119795799255,0.0212456660810858,0.07670823860356411,0.2769625220197926,2024-12-27

m40p7w2,"This is a great answer and awesome considering the fact small caps and the russell are the ultimate bargan stocks where value is maximized. It is truly an unfair market in small cap world, if a company is not a golden child down there it will be treated as a future bankrupsy by the big boys. End result is the good and the bad tend to drop 90% or so. Market manipulation is rampant and people get their hands cut all the time. The wildness of it is what makes it the ultimate challenge and the most rewarding when it works out though.

m3znp73,"Nothing too technical although I do watch like 20 stock very closely all the time and make trades on so I have a feel for how they move. Anything that has good liquidity but has volatile movement works. I don't even look at the implied volatility just watch stocks that tend to make big movements down or up and try to enter a position on a dip relative to it's normal price. WMT is a great stock that you can do this with. SMR, ASTS, OKLO are some examples of smaller sector stocks that are cheap but move volatile. If you have more money you are able to do this with stocks like TSLA, MSTR, GOOGL, AAPL. It's really just doing your homework and having a good idea of what direction it's going in and try to enter at the best dip or point of entry. PDT is pattern day trader and it's avoided by using settled cash.

1gu77l5,"Palantir $PLTR is extremely overpriced.. **1. Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High** Palantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers. GuruFocus: 18% year-over-year growth This deceleration doesn’t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable. **3. Profitability Is Still Questionable** Despite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability. **4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble** The market has been overly optimistic about Palantir’s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It’s easy to talk AI; it’s harder to monetize it sustainably. **5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence** Executives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.

If it drops 6% and I sell, causing a $3k loss, I get to write that off on my taxes. Then, I would immediately purchase $47,000 in QQQ to avoid wash. 6% is mild correction territory, not a huge collapse, so I’d expect it to go back up soon after purchasing the QQQ and then I’m back to where I started plus $3k in negative capital gains to help my tax situation.

1gs7h8a,"Enphase looking interesting as a long investment. Enphase looking very interesting here Enphase has sold off along with other solar stocks post election, but I think the move has been overdone. I think it’s unlikely the new administration can totally repeal the IRA, I’d put the chances under 5%. The Trump admin may be able to “water down” some of the provisions by changing some of the requirements to meet domestic content criteria for the tax credit. Enphase is entering into agreements to avoid this like this agreement yesterday: The agreement makes certain customers can still qualify for the credit in 2025 despite any changes to the law. In the meantime, the stock trades at a market cap of a little over $8 billion, has $400 million in net cash, and at the peak of the last cycle in 2022 it was generating $600 million in FCF, or $400 million exclusive of SBC. Margins seems to be recovering, op margin is back up to 13%. Inventory balances are down at the company and per the company inventory in the channel is roughly balanced. Analyst forecasts have been marked down, but are still showing a return to over $600 million in FCF by 2026 and over $1 billion by 2028. I think the larger mega trend of solar energy becoming cheaper and more widely available is very powerful and the technological advantage of micro inverters over string inverters should mean increasing market share. The company has a 45% share in residential solar and has been increasing its battery system attach rates. It’ll have new technology next year with new batteries. Customers at Enphase seem really happy with the product. I am not at all concerned with competition from Solar Edge, and probably the main competitor to worry about is Tesla Powerwall, but I think string inverters are an inferior technology and customers do not seem as happy with powerwall. If you check r/solar the general consensus is Enphase is the best product.

1grgefd,"Applied Materials Earnings Beat Expectations.. Applied Materials ([AMAT]( reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ expectations, sending shares lower after the bell Thursday despite a revenue beat. The [semiconductor]( equipment maker saw revenue grow 5% year-over-year to $7.05 billion, above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. However, net income at $1.73 billion or $2.09 per share was down from $2 billion or $2.38 per share a year earlier and fell short of expectations.1 Looking ahead, Applied Materials said it anticipates first-quarter revenue of $7.15 billion, plus or minus $400 million, below the analyst consensus at the midpoint. Its projection for [earnings per share]( of $2.29 was above the consensus. # Sales in China Slow Revenue from China totaled $2.14 billion, 28% lower than a year ago. Last month, analysts warned that Applied Materials and other semiconductor equipment makers could be hit by a [slowdown in demand]( in the country for dynamic random access memory, a key data-storage component used in computers.

1gqlkdf,"$KNSL's continues to grow... even after a 20% stock dip.. I had never heard of Kinsale Capital Group ($KNSL) before. But recently, I found out that since its IPO in 2016, this insurance stock has been up almost 2,500%. $KNSL has consistently outperformed the S&P 500, and their financials look really strong. Revenue is currently at an all-time high of $1.47 billion, with the most recent quarter bringing in almost $397 million. And free cash flow near all time highs at $268M. Earlier this year, the stock took a 30% nosedive after the CEO spooked investors on earnings call, saying that future growth will be slower (10-20% instead of the historical 40%). There's also been some [insider selling]( to go along with that. And even though stock price has recovered since then, $KSNL continues to trade at a low P/E ratio of 24.2, way below its average of 38.4. I'm thinking, even if the company grows at a modest 10-20%, this stock looks like a steal at the current P/E ratio. However, insurance industry is still a bit of a mystery to me. The CEO is obviously trying to manage investor expectations here. But, their recent P/E seems too low. Especially if the company accomplishes the high end of 20% growth.",post,ValueInvesting,2024-11-13 19:41:57,0.06367713212966919,KNSL,1,1301,211,19,2,2024-11-13,positive,0.5245472937822342,0.7411335706710815,0.0422801598906517,0.21658627688884735,positive,0.9999953458502091,0.9999957084655762,3.908817234332673e-06,3.626153670666099e-07,positive,0.9810500079765916,0.990462601184845,0.00012479943688958883,0.009412593208253384,positive,0.8582858946174383,0.8705284595489502,0.11722896248102188,0.012242564931511879,0.8409696355566183,0.048444879491182015,0.22010197520963326,2024-11-13

1gu32t9,"Two Liquidations. During the Great Depression, Ben Graham wrote: “Is American Business Worth More Dead than Alive?” He pointed out that many corporations were selling for substantially less than what they were worth if liquidated. This way of thinking has been a basis to analyze businesses for almost 100 years, proving a successful strategy given an adequate margin of safety, which depends on the situation. The liquidation analysis is the method that I feel the most comfortable with while analyzing the value of a business. For example, let’s say I was offered a furniture store for sale; they have some cash, inventory, and the retail space where they are located, with just a few payables as their liabilities. Cash is valued at face. It is very unlikely that inventory will be liquidated below cost; most will be gone in a couple of weeks at those prices. The property could be sold in less than a year in most markets, or it may take two years if I wanted to maximize the selling price by getting a new NNN tenant. But in public markets, the discount to liquidation value will vary depending on what management might do; in the case of a land bank with no intention to liquidate, it might be appropriate to ask for a 50-75% discount, while in others, a smaller discount will be appropriate. When a company announces an intention to liquidate or sell out, it is acceptable to ask for a smaller discount, simply because value is likely to be realized in a shorter time frame. The first company is ESSA Pharma ($EPIX), a busted biotech that announced the termination of its treatment studies: Working Capital-> $124.30 Lease Liabilities-> ($0.23) Severance Pay-> ($4.00) Expenses/Cash Burn-> ($14.50) - ($29.00) Net Asset Value-> $105.57 - $91.07 Shares Out-> 47.31 NAV/Share-> $1.92 - $2.23 I value working capital at face value because they have $126 million in cash with some current liabilities. My severance pay estimate is based on what the prospectus says executives will get in case of a change of status. My expenses/cash burn estimate is simply 2 and 4 quarters of last quarter’s operating losses. While I don’t expect the company to burn as much cash as recently due to terminating the studies, there are expenses associated with liquidation in which I don’t have the most expertise, but 1 year of active study cash burn or 23% of the company’s value seems more than enough. While the company’s executives have stock options, the strike prices are all higher than my liquidation estimates, so I didn’t include them in shares outstanding. The stock closed last Friday at $1.72, giving an estimated return between 11% and 30%, more than satisfactory considering that the company is a cash box and shouldn’t be hard to liquidate. The second company is Zytronic Plc (ZYT.L), a touchscreen manufacturer in the UK. Last week they announced the conclusion of their strategic review: Cash-> £3.30 Receivables-> £1.41 Inventory-> £3.05 Property at 90%-> £3.33 Total Liabilities-> (£0.93) Liquidation Costs-> (£2.00) Net Asset Value-> £8.16 Shares Out-> 10.17 NAV/Share-> £0.80 They reported the cash balance as of November 13th. I used receivables, inventory, and liabilities numbers from their last report in March and the property market value estimate they announced on the",post,ValueInvesting,2024-11-18 11:58:22,0.061883408576250076,NNN,1,4017,595,11,0,2024-11-18,neutral,0.014742948114871979,0.05875068157911301,0.8972415924072266,0.04400773346424103,neutral,-9.644326928537339e-05,0.00010994212061632425,0.9996836185455322,0.00020638538990169764,neutral,-0.014621207141317427,0.0008990004425868392,0.9835808277130127,0.015520207583904266,neutral,-0.19562490284442902,0.052792757749557495,0.6987895369529724,0.2484176605939865,-0.04889990128503996,0.009711814916278996,0.09854854091400338,2024-11-18

m3y982f,"People are commenting about ACA, but I'd say the problem is with health in general. A true worst case scenario would cost you multiple times your entire net worth, if you get hit by a bad enough disease. Also, so many people get divorced, that you really ought to at least estimate what your assets and expenses would be in such a case, where you aren't sharing as many costs. You didn't say how much your house was worth or how much Social Security owes you, but assuming your house is worth, say, $460k to get to a round number of $2 million total assets (you can tap into home equity in emergencies), and that social security will be $10-20k/year, then you COULD pull the trigger now and likely be fine. You are definitely not ""100%"" safe though, no matter what calculators say.

m3y8gzh,"TBF looks like a pretty good mirror to TLT. It's 1:1 though, so hedging with it might mean you basically have no long position. You could potentially use a lot less TTT (3x) to hedge, but it's unpredictable and can decay. In an extended downturn it will outperform, but there's no guarantee you have the hedge when you want it. So maybe puts are the cheapest downside protection. If you're long TFT then the short positions will necessarily eat into that, but if you specifically want it they'll give you inversely correlated price direction - so in any moving market you'll have one going up and one going down.",comment,investing,2024-12-26 23:32:11,0.018076177686452866,TLT,1,614,109,23,3,2024-12-26,neutral,-0.1451101191341877,0.05489882454276085,0.7450922131538391,0.20000894367694855,neutral,0.09929710812866688,0.10970038175582886,0.879896342754364,0.01040327362716198,positive,0.7047527018003166,0.7097465395927429,0.2852596044540405,0.004993837792426348,neutral,0.04491540789604187,0.19298505783081055,0.6589453220367432,0.14806964993476868,0.1759637746727094,0.13525254231029862,0.36776696739960024,2024-12-26

m3xs4di,">The company is notoriously tight-lipped. This wasn't true until recently. Look at their investor presentations from 2021 and 2022. Also listen to their earnings calls. I think they've stopped sharing updates because they've stalled. All they can do at this point is become a materials supplier for other companies to do their own R&D. This is essentially the deal they have with SKOn and BMW (who installed a sister production line of their own to work the problem in parallel). >That said, at a dollar and change, you can't expect any guarantee of anything. Right. And being cheap doesn't mean good value. The one big thing they have going for them is liquidity. Their burn rate should carry them well into the back half of the decade. I'm not saying you can't invest in them. But I think it's closer to a scratch-off lotto ticket, and generally a bad bet long term.",comment,stocks,2024-12-26 21:54:04,0.011073613539338112,SLDP,1,877,152,21,3,2024-12-26,neutral,-0.2409742847084999,0.04986795037984848,0.6592898368835449,0.2908422350883484,neutral,-0.02201481396332383,0.00010773492977023125,0.9777697324752808,0.022122548893094063,negative,-0.9882007265696302,0.000717518269084394,0.010364263318479061,0.9889182448387146,negative,-0.7199862347915769,0.01315316092222929,0.2537074387073517,0.7331393957138062,-0.4927940150082577,0.194030115764958,0.44048849674532703,2024-12-26

m3xejds,"I think your ""designed to be sold"" premise is a bit off. That might be the direction it's trending, but I don't think that was the original intention. Frankly, WBD leadership was just wrong about how easy it would be to turn a profit with streaming. And they weren't the only ones. It's the same issue that's plagued all the media giants and why I don't see anyone going after WBD as a whole any time soon. Mergers aren't the answer here. Bigger doesn't mean better when the issue is the product. Customers are leaving cable, which kills your advertising revenue. Even if they switch to your streaming service, they aren't locked into that plan like they are with cable. People bounce around a lot based on what they want to watch, which was a behavior that didn't exist a few years ago when there were fewer services and they could share subscriptions. Sports is probably the only reliable answer to keep people watching one service, but securing the broadcasting rights is incredibly expensive too. On top of all of that, a good chunk of the profits that streaming services have seen so far is due to price increases and password-sharing crackdowns, not because of major improvements in the product.

Given that you only have to make it 18-20 years until age 59.5 you could probably survive solely on the brokerage until then if you chose to. With that said, I would suggest partitioning the Trad IRA into several smaller IRAs, so that you can toggle SEPP on them if needed or desired.

m4aajco,"Thanks for the feedback. Yeah I think this only works if natural gas stays above $4 for a sustained period of time. I’ve thought about this associated gas issue with shale oil for some time. I figured gas assets were kind of a dead market in the U.S. for this reason. What piqued my interest is the fact that long term nat gas futures all inflected sharply higher and the winter contracts have stayed above $4 ever since Russia-Ukraine. The U.S. produces something like 105 bcf per day. Current LNG export capacity is somewhere around 14-15 bcf equivalent. In 2025 we are adding something like 42 MTPA which roughly 6 bcf/day. In 2026 we should add something similar. I’m coming to somewhere around 24-25 bcf of export capacity by 2026, which is around 25% of all US production. The European gas import prices have generally been above $10/mmbtu, and the cost of liquefaction, shipping, and regasification should be something like $3-4 per mcf. So if/when the LNG export capacity gets large enough, there should be this “convergence trade” of U.S. to EU gas prices. Of course longer term extra capacity from other countries like Australia and Qatar might come into play. There’s a bunch of Qatari additions but it looks like these are likely coming online 2027-2029. I think it’s likely gas prices come down in Europe. But I think US gas prices ought to have increasing upward pressure with each new LNG plant that comes online.",comment,SecurityAnalysis,2024-12-29 01:29:21,0.0357142835855484,EXE,2,1448,247,1,6,2024-12-29,neutral,0.18262143060564995,0.22951504588127136,0.7235913276672363,0.046893615275621414,neutral,-8.098996477201581e-05,0.0007583642145618796,0.9984022974967957,0.0008393541793338954,positive,0.952387191937305,0.9534677267074585,0.045451752841472626,0.0010805347701534629,positive,0.4796342048794031,0.5006845593452454,0.4782651364803314,0.021050354465842247,0.4036404593643965,0.17291281519624893,0.41582786726751364,2024-12-29

The European gas import prices have generally been above $10/mmbtu, and the cost of liquefaction, shipping, and regasification should be something like $3-4 per mcf. So if/when the LNG export capacity gets large enough, there should be this “convergence trade” of U.S. to EU gas prices. Of course longer term extra capacity from other countries like Australia and Qatar might come into play. There’s a bunch of Qatari additions but it looks like these are likely coming online 2027-2029. I think it’s likely gas prices come down in Europe. But I think US gas prices ought to have increasing upward pressure with each new LNG plant that comes online.",comment,SecurityAnalysis,2024-12-29 01:29:21,0.0357142835855484,LNG,2,1448,247,1,6,2024-12-29,neutral,0.18262143060564995,0.22951504588127136,0.7235913276672363,0.046893615275621414,neutral,-8.098996477201581e-05,0.0007583642145618796,0.9984022974967957,0.0008393541793338954,positive,0.952387191937305,0.9534677267074585,0.045451752841472626,0.0010805347701534629,positive,0.4796342048794031,0.5006845593452454,0.4782651364803314,0.021050354465842247,0.4036404593643965,0.17291281519624893,0.41582786726751364,2024-12-29

And since NTG’s Egyptian employees speak the same language and share a time zone & culture with SA enterprises, and NTG has deep connections in the region with 30 years of business there, they have a major edge over the competition. Valuation is 11 TTM PE and I estimate half that on a forward basis. Revenue and net income growth has been high double digits and even higher. And I don’t expect things to slow down in the near term.

1gs749w,Need help interpreting financial reports. Fidelity app says that VTLE has earnings growth of 2103% but [yahoo finance]( describes their earnings as weak. The Fidelity app also shows a much shorter bar for EPS 3rd quarter this year compared to last year.

I bought them a few months ago because I really like the company, and they’ve been performing well. From what I’ve been seeing, their main competitor has been losing customers to them, which seems like a good sign for their future growth.

This also seems very undervalued on the fundamentals and they have a potential blockbuster obesity drug (once a day pill) on the horizon. It’s down 4.5% today due to RFK being named HHS director, which seems like a nothing burger to me. 6.5% dividend and from what i read, they have a decent drug pipeline coming in the future.

1greyef,"Deep dive into Cal-Maine - Cracking the shell: The complex World of Eggs. **1.0 Introduction** Every once in a while, I stumble upon a company that seems simple, yet, turns out to be incredibly complex. Cal-Maine is one that fits this description. It is the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the U.S. (market share of \~14.5%), and its closest competitor is almost half its size. Based on the description, one would expect that this is a relatively simple company. I mean, **it only sells eggs, right?** What if I told you that the management has very little control over a business of this kind? There’s a lot to unpack, so let’s get started. **2.0 The eggs** In theory, the revenue generated would be equal to the **number of eggs sold** multiplied by the **average egg price**. So let’s have a look at these two variables: Cal-Maine sells two types of eggs: * **Specialty** \- These encompass a broad range of products, such as cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised, and nutritionally enhanced eggs. * **Conventional** \- all other shell eggs Why is this important? The specialty eggs are typically sold at prices and terms negotiated directly with customers. Unlike conventional, where the wholesale prices are volatile. In 2024, the company sold 12% more dozens than back in 2018. This is more impressive than it sounds, as this is not a growing market. The demand for eggs is relatively stable, in fact, and it only grows with an increase in population. This indicates the company has slightly increased its market share during this time. To illustrate how stable the sales were in terms of volume, the 12% increase from 2018 to 2024 came without any down year. But more importantly, the composition has changed. In 2018, about 244m dozens of specialty eggs were sold. This number increased to 401m in 2024 (**+64%**)! The % of specialty eggs of the total eggs sold increased from 24% to 35%. Here are the prices from 2018 to 2024: Conventional: $1.23 --> $1.04 --> $0.98 --> $0.98 --> $1.42 --> $2.73 --> $1.73 Specialty: $1.92 --> $1.93 --> $1.88 --> $1.88 --> $1.93 --> $2.40 --> 2.31 The specialty eggs are not only more expensive, but the price is significantly more stable. Well, except for 2023. What was that about? Why were conventional eggs more expensive? The answer is **HPAI**, known as “**Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza**” which is deadly to domestic poultry and can wipe out entire flocks within a matter of days. When there is an HPAI outbreak, there is a significant decrease in supply, which pushes the price up. This is unpredictable, and the only way to deal with this is to mitigate the risk by having multiple locations, something that Cal-Maine has. The volatility of egg prices ***(per dozen)*** is significant, so despite the volume of dozens sold being stable, it is impossible to forecast the revenue of the company over time, given the volatility of the prices. But this is just the start. **3.0 The direct costs** The largest direct cost relates to feed. The vast majority of the corn and soybeans are purchased from suppliers in the U.S. and there is quite some volatility. **So the management isn’t in control of the costs, nor the revenue.** That is a tough position to be in. This is exactly why the financials are all over the place, despite the stable sales from a volume point of view. Over the last decade: \- The gross margin has fluctuated between **12% and 38%.** \- The operating margin has fluctuated between **-2% and 31%.** **4.0 Now what?** So, what can the management do? Not much, other than being prepared for a bad year, as it is only a matter of time before that happens. For that reason, the company has **no debt**. In addition, its dividend policy is defined in relation to its profitability. The quarterly dividend payout is 1/3rd of its quarterly net income. This is definitely reasonable. Where does the remaining cash go to? * **Acquisitions** \- There have been a total of 24 acquisitions, ranging from 160,000 to 7.5m layers. * **Inv",post,ValueInvesting,2024-11-14 20:52:35,0.065470851957798,HPAI,1,4074,692,20,3,2024-11-14,neutral,0.04389592073857784,0.05829054117202759,0.9273148775100708,0.014394620433449745,neutral,8.306947847813717e-06,1.0406819455965888e-05,0.9999874830245972,2.0998716081521707e-06,neutral,1.0601448593661189e-05,9.242740634363145e-05,0.9998257756233215,8.182595774997026e-05,neutral,0.29586048424243927,0.32217833399772644,0.65150386095047,0.02631784975528717,0.08494382834436465,0.020199487426622236,0.14212490079722917,2024-11-14

The vast majority of the corn and soybeans are purchased from suppliers in the U.S. and there is quite some volatility. **So the management isn’t in control of the costs, nor the revenue.** That is a tough position to be in. This is exactly why the financials are all over the place, despite the stable sales from a volume point of view. Over the last decade: \- The gross margin has fluctuated between **12% and 38%.** \- The operating margin has fluctuated between **-2% and 31%.** **4.0 Now what?** So, what can the management do? Not much, other than being prepared for a bad year, as it is only a matter of time before that happens. For that reason, the company has **no debt**. In addition, its dividend policy is defined in relation to its profitability. The quarterly dividend payout is 1/3rd of its quarterly net income. This is definitely reasonable. Where does the remaining cash go to? * **Acquisitions** \- There have been a total of 24 acquisitions, ranging from 160,000 to 7.5m layers. * **Inv",post,stocks,2024-11-14 20:52:11,0.013710187748074532,HPAI,1,4074,692,20,3,2024-11-14,neutral,0.04389592073857784,0.05829054117202759,0.9273148775100708,0.014394620433449745,neutral,8.306947847813717e-06,1.0406819455965888e-05,0.9999874830245972,2.0998716081521707e-06,neutral,1.0601448593661189e-05,9.242740634363145e-05,0.9998257756233215,8.182595774997026e-05,neutral,0.29586048424243927,0.32217833399772644,0.65150386095047,0.02631784975528717,0.08494382834436465,0.020199487426622236,0.14212490079722917,2024-11-14

1grdtdz,"$MRK - Merck & Co - Analysis and Valuation. I have been slowly trimming other portfolio positions in areas that look expensive to me today, and I am making an addition of $MRK (Merck & Co) today. I believe the company to be a high quality company that investors can acquire shares in today at a fair price with a modest margin of safety. Included will be some fundamentals analysis and my DCF workup. First, let's review the fundamentals: The company is not all that cyclical, which we would tend to expect from a major pharmaceutical player in the healthcare space. They have reported positive earnings for shareholders in all of the last 10 years and a general trend of growing earnings during that same span of time. Management has been a more than decent steward of capital, averaging over a 15% ROIC over the past five years and a 16% ROIC on a TTM basis. Long term debt does not look like a hindrance and they could pay off all debt with earnings in less than three years. Altman Z-score: 3+ F score: 7 Sentiment towards this company is not all that favorable today, depressing the earnings multiple. While a company this size is not extremely exciting in terms of rapid growth, I do see their LaNova Medicines licensing deal in China as additive to the company, as well as the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics. Their recent FDA approval Winrevair and their progress on an RSV treatment also look like strong drivers of future sales where demand already is strong, meaning a costly advertising and selling regime is likely not a necessity. Valuation wise, I felt that analysts were fairly aggressive on their FCF targets for the next few years, and I did bump those back to what I saw as more appropriate growth bands for a company of this size and maturity. Despite reducing analyst FCF growth expectations and glide sloping them to a 2.5% FCF growth rate in the out years, I still found about a 30% margin of safety to buy at today's price of just under $100 dollars. For that reason, I've opened a new position in the company today and will begin to dollar cost average into that up to my desired allocation of my portfolio. My stripped down version of my DCF workup is included below.",post,ValueInvesting,2024-11-14 20:03:11,0.06098654866218567,MRK,1,2203,393,20,3,2024-11-14,positive,0.4494367390871048,0.4882628619670868,0.47291094064712524,0.038826122879981995,positive,0.9999997099162847,0.9999997615814209,2.281906432699543e-07,5.166513616927659e-08,positive,0.9955966593697667,0.9974687099456787,0.000659249082673341,0.0018720505759119987,positive,0.5808857046067715,0.5950844883918762,0.3907167315483093,0.014198783785104752,0.7564797032449819,0.08052918218406163,0.2837766413644041,2024-11-14

Both CPI and Core CPI are as expected.. * October CPI rose 2.6% YOY matching the expected 2.6% * Core CPI rose 3.3% YOY matching the expected 3.3% * The probability of a Fed interest rate cut of 25 basis points on Dec. 18th was 58.7% prior to this CPI report. This report should increase the probability of another rate cut before the end of the year. * The economy will benefit as the interest rates come down. The Fed has already cut 75bp this year fueling economy expansion with cheaper lending and increasing investments by corporations. * Looser regulations and the expected tax cut for corporations with the upcoming administration will further propel the economy. This will ameliorate the recent disappointing employment data. The October Unemployment rate was 4.1% matching the expected 4.1%. However, two major hurricanes and several labor strikes, including a massive one at Boeing heavily contributed to October nonfarm payrolls rose only by 12,000 which was much lower than the expected 105,000. * Loans are much less likely to go on to default as inflation comes down. A study by credit agency TransUnion has shown that inflation pushes borrowers with low FICO scores to default.

1gqc901,"Bottom Fishing. While the share price of a company with a surplus of assets and little to no debt may decrease from adverse business climates, the margin of safety the company has built around itself will give it the flexibility to be able to make adjustments to its operations as needed. This should help to decrease how far the stock’s share price falls. Most importantly, when a company enters into a period of economic downturn this margin of safety in the form of no debt and a lot of assets will help the company recover faster once economic conditions return to normal. Today our lesson delves into another contrarian investment philosophy that many stock analysts would warn against… bottom fishing. Bottom Fishing How do you mitigate the risk of a large share price decline after you purchase a stock? Buy it when the price is near a low point compared to the company’s share price history. If a company is suffering a large decline in its share price because of economic factors that are fairly broad in nature and effect not just the company in question but the company’s competitors… this may be a buying opportunity. If the businesses you are looking at have a substantial surplus of assets and little to no debt, you should be able to tell if they are going to be able to weather this particular economic storm. If the share price is sitting at or near its lowest point in a long while and it’s apparent that the company in question can pay its bills, you can oftentimes expect a share price bounce back once problems in these businesses subside. While it is true that an investor may have to exercise some patience when applying this investing strategy to their portfolio, these kind of bottom fishing opportunities are not that uncommon. Investors normally rush out of a stock once that business starts to fall on hard times. Those investors probably have good reason to sell too. When you follow a trend and purchase a stock at or near all time highs any reduction in price can be both dramatic and sustained. The fear of missing out will make investors blindly buy into “stories” instead of balance sheets and comprehensive statements of income. When this happens people will purchase these stocks no matter the price and no matter how overvalued the stock has become. This creates a large cliff for the share price to fall from. As was discussed in my last newsletter, once a sell-off begins it can keep going for reasons that do not have to necessarily line up with the economic conditions of the company. People generally speaking, have an enormous disposition to being overly dramatic. They’ll run a stock up too high then sell it down lower than the business’s actual economic reality would suggest is fair. This is because when people panic sell they aren’t taking their time to take a deep dive and assess the economic reality of the business, they’re just worried they’re going to lose a lot of money and want to stop the bleeding. This type of mindset is what creates bottom fishing opportunities. The best way to avoid becoming the panicked investor selling on a dip is to simply buy a stock at a severely undervalued price. When you buy a stock at or near a historic low the distance to the floor price is fairly close but the distance to that stock’s share price ceiling is probably much farther away than buying into companies whose share prices are already at all time highs. Now let’s take a closer look an example of a company that is currently down on their luck. Intrepid Potash, Inc. (NYSE:IPI) has had its stock beaten down over the course of the last couple of years for several reasons.

1gqab7f,Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is projected to report quarterly earnings at $0.11 per share on revenue of $2.96 billion.. I am bullish on Nubank who has seen growth in serving the Latin America unbanked and underbanked segments. Nubank has much room for future growth as the customer base continues to grow. Another exponential growth opportunity is branching out into other regions like the US and Asia. Indonesia has a large underbanked population like Latin America Nubank has already succeeded in tapping. I expect the earnings result after Wednesday market close to be positive.

1gqa9ht,"Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy. Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). The I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231). I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains. But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened: Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%. Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss. I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value. Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more. I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend. It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

1gu1oyl,"Is iRobot (IRBT) Undervalued After the Failed Amazon Acquisition?. Hey everyone, I’ve been keeping an eye on iRobot (IRBT) ever since the Amazon acquisition fell apart, and it’s been rough—stock has dropped hard. But looking at it now, I can’t help but wonder - is it undervalued or will it continue to stagnate? Workforce cuts and leaner operations: iRobot recently slashed 40% of its workforce, which makes it leaner and could help with profitability—it’s slowly moving back into the black. But I fear with less people it is also less likely to innovate or move into new territories? Intellectual property and general potential of the robotics market: The company holds a lot of intellectual property in the robotics space, which could still make it an attractive acquisition target down the line. There’s also long-term potential in robotics beyond vacuums—think warehouse automation, which Amazon was allegedly eyeing. The robotics sector still has plenty of room to grow, and iRobot could benefit from broader trends in automation and smart home tech. No News = No Momentum: It feels like the company is in limbo. There’s no new product buzz, no big announcements, and management has been quiet. I thing that any good news—be it a new partnership, product, or acquisition interest—could breathe life into the stock. What do you think? Do you see potential for the stock to recover?

1gtwjvx,"Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars. [ TSLA +5% overnight due to this news. (Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter. If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence. Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said. One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said. The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment. Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc. Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome. Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled. NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed. A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",post,stocks,2024-11-18 04:22:41,0.03870491310954094,TSLA,1,3637,520,4,0,2024-11-18,neutral,0.1672196239233017,0.1886902153491974,0.7898392081260681,0.02147059142589569,neutral,0.03717616268841084,0.037247709929943085,0.9626808166503906,7.154724153224379e-05,positive,0.9829936965834349,0.9855136871337891,0.011966291815042496,0.002519990550354123,neutral,0.4785965709015727,0.4854666590690613,0.5076632499694824,0.006870088167488575,0.41649651352418005,0.17693279059586864,0.42063379630727327,2024-11-18

m3xdst1,"You can only contribute $23,500 to your 401k unless your plan allows you to do a mega backdoor Roth conversion, but that's Roth; it won't be tax deferred. You would have to do it over several years. Yes, if you can max an IRA you should do so. Traditional IRAs get in the way of backdoor Roth, something to keep in mind in case you'll ever find yourself in a situation you can't contribute to IRAs any longer. So for 2025 Max $23.5k plus max $7k would be $30.5k. See if you have access to a HSA, treat it as another retirement account, that adds another $4,150 max contribution.",comment,investing,2024-12-26 20:33:58,0.018398966640233994,GS,1,580,109,20,3,2024-12-26,neutral,0.02715117484331131,0.052943408489227295,0.9212644100189209,0.025792233645915985,neutral,-2.5865252155199414e-05,2.3691322894592304e-06,0.9999693632125854,2.8234384444658644e-05,neutral,-2.5830220693023875e-05,5.77809005335439e-05,0.9998586177825928,8.361112122656778e-05,neutral,-0.08592246472835541,0.06245177984237671,0.78917396068573,0.14837424457073212,-0.01470574633947308,0.002418273891658469,0.04917594830461807,2024-12-26

m3ynsfj,Apple was that cheap because everyone hated the stock. After owning the consumer PC market in the early 80’s they had 15 years of decline. Absolutely no hope of ever being relevant again.

Things from your link that I agree with / am not surprised to read: * ""[The NLSY79] shows that each point increase in IQ test scores raises income by between $234 and $616 per year after holding a variety of factors constant."" * ""Previous research, discussed below, has investigated the relationship between intelligence and income and found individuals with higher IQ test scores have higher income."" * ""[Herrnstein and Murray (1994)] showed that few people with high IQ test scores are in poverty."" * ""While almost all of the above research suggests finances and intelligence are linked, Stanley and Danko (1996), in the best-selling financial book “The Millionaire Next Door,” believe intelligence is not related to wealth. They write, “It is seldom luck or inheritance or advanced degrees or even intelligence that enables people to amass fortunes.” However, while this idea is stated, no data are presented to back up this statement."" Things from your link that are new info to me or surprising: * ""Regression results suggest no statistically distinguishable relationship between IQ scores and wealth."" * ""Financial distress, such as problems paying bills, going bankrupt or reaching credit card limits, is related to IQ scores not linearly but instead in a quadratic relationship."" * ""[Johnson and Neal (1998)] found black women earned 5% more per hour than similarly aged white women with the same IQ test score."" Setting aside whether it's true that IQ & wealth have a relationship, I don't agree it's necessarily harmful to acknowledge. It's definitely *uncomfortable* that innate ability might affect life outcomes. But I also think it's harmful to tell everyone that they can achieve any level of wealth irrespective of their God-given talent -- the corollary to that is that if they don't accomplish their goals, it must be their fault somehow.",comment,financialindependence,2024-12-28 18:51:12,0.04569687694311142,IQ,1,2169,345,18,5,2024-12-28,neutral,0.08492518588900566,0.1202988401055336,0.8443275094032288,0.03537365421652794,neutral,0.00541760865598917,0.014717070385813713,0.9759834408760071,0.009299461729824543,positive,0.852187663607765,0.852651834487915,0.146884024143219,0.0004641708801500499,neutral,0.048863157629966736,0.1833377629518509,0.6821876764297485,0.13447460532188416,0.24784840394568164,0.1633792448356589,0.40420198519509887,2024-12-28

m483yve,"From my understanding their bread and butter is taking software and data analytics that a regular business would buy, and tweaking it to fit defense. For example if Toyota buys a simulation software for their own R&D, Leidos makes a copy of that but built specially for defense. But the real bull case is that they do machine learning and AI type stuff, similar to how Oracle and IBM gave business analytics to companies long before AI was a huge thing, but they do it for various defense industries. Also some industries are surprisingly in the stone ages. Your bank is likely surviving on some pretty old technology. It’s even worse for defense and gov. So the army for example has no problem throwing $900M to Leidos so they can modernize their info tech and cybersecurity. “Leidos will leverage current commercial technology and industry investments…” - They literally pitch the military: hey this donut shop uses cloud, you guys should too, we can figure this out for you, stop using ancient tech.",comment,ValueInvesting,2024-12-28 18:09:19,0.0520179383456707,IBM,1,1006,172,18,5,2024-12-28,neutral,-0.012696314603090286,0.04314211383461952,0.9010194540023804,0.05583842843770981,neutral,-0.0035021748626604676,0.00010319834109395742,0.9962913990020752,0.003605373203754425,neutral,-5.2621064241975546e-05,0.00014789016859140247,0.9996515512466431,0.00020051123283337802,neutral,-0.006845071911811829,0.14706096053123474,0.6990330219268799,0.15390603244304657,-0.0057740456104511395,2.898700029243048e-05,0.005383957679294153,2024-12-28

m4a85f1,"**Competition** Temu and TikTok have been expanding aggressively worldwide. But they have experienced limited success in their commerce business in Southeast Asia and Latin America against the likes of Sea Ltd and Mercado Libre. Why is that? Sea Ltd's leaders explained on one of their earnings call that Temu & TikTok win because of (a) selection and (b) cost. But Sea already offers a wide selection because they onboarded Chinese suppliers several years ago when they were competing with Lazada after Alibaba invested in Lazada. So when Temu and TikTok started competing in the market, Sea's market share did not decline; in fact they continued to grow. Temu and TikTok took share away from weaker competitors like Lazada and Tokopedia that couldn't compete in terms of selection. Sea operated for years against price competition, so they learned to become profitable even when there were aggressive discounts, etc. by launching their fintech and ad businesses. Uber is similar - from Uber One to ads, they have also learned to become profitable without raising their prices aggressively. They have cost leadership in the business. Uber's CFO recently mentioned that they aim to continue being a low cost provider. I predict that the secondary competitors like Lyft who haven't been able to make a profit will continue to fall behind and eventually get acquired or close down from AVs entering the market, but not Uber. **Threats to Uber's dominance** The 2 biggest threats to Uber's dominance are actually drivers and insurance. Naturally, drivers want to make enough money and hopefully more money each year as inflation grows. But Uber wants more supply - which improves customer experiences but creates more competition for drivers. If drivers pool together to strike, get unionized, or have legislation passed to guarantee minimum wage, etc. all of them will increase Uber's prices to consumers. Consumers are price sensitive to ride hailing, so volumes would fall and hurt Uber's business. Uber takes a standard cut and they're profitable today without raising prices; it's likely that Uber will continue to keep its cut low to increase gross bookings. Insurance is another threat - today insurers are price gouging the likes of Uber and the cost is impacted by several hundred basis points because of this. Uber has already recognized this threat and has started collecting data to use as proof to negotiate for lower auto insurance. We should start seeing some improvements in the next few quarters. Low insurance costs mean lower Uber ride prices which will also increase volumes. **AV is a boon, not a bane** Unlike drivers, AVs do not need to get paid a minimum wage to survive. If or when AVs become the norm, Uber will be able to offer significantly cheaper Uber ride prices and increase ride volumes significantly. Imagine if a ride costs $5 instead of $30 today - how many more rides will be happening? I reckon it'd be 10x or more. Likewise, if AVs are able to match Tesla's ambition of 100x passenger safety, then insurance costs will naturally come down, which is another tailwind for Uber. **Why Waymo and Tesla won't threaten Uber** Waymo and Tesla are the frontrunners of AV. But they don't operate and optimize fleets. There is a lot of unsexy work behind the fleet management business. The biggest one is customer support. Google is definitely not known to offer any kind of meaningful customer support. As for Tesla, their ambition is to transform the world's ICE fleet to electric vehicles. They'd likely want to focus on scaling manufacturing and license their AV technology so they can expand quickly throughout the world. Plus, China has promising AV technology as well. So the AV industry isn't a winner take all - which means that they'll likely find it more advantageous to work with a seasoned partner like Uber - who isn't greedy and just wants to maintain their low cost pricing while increasing rideshare volumes - to scale their AV fleet business.

m4a85f1,"**Competition** Temu and TikTok have been expanding aggressively worldwide. But they have experienced limited success in their commerce business in Southeast Asia and Latin America against the likes of Sea Ltd and Mercado Libre. Why is that? Sea Ltd's leaders explained on one of their earnings call that Temu & TikTok win because of (a) selection and (b) cost. But Sea already offers a wide selection because they onboarded Chinese suppliers several years ago when they were competing with Lazada after Alibaba invested in Lazada. So when Temu and TikTok started competing in the market, Sea's market share did not decline; in fact they continued to grow. Temu and TikTok took share away from weaker competitors like Lazada and Tokopedia that couldn't compete in terms of selection. Sea operated for years against price competition, so they learned to become profitable even when there were aggressive discounts, etc. by launching their fintech and ad businesses. Uber is similar - from Uber One to ads, they have also learned to become profitable without raising their prices aggressively. They have cost leadership in the business. Uber's CFO recently mentioned that they aim to continue being a low cost provider. I predict that the secondary competitors like Lyft who haven't been able to make a profit will continue to fall behind and eventually get acquired or close down from AVs entering the market, but not Uber. **Threats to Uber's dominance** The 2 biggest threats to Uber's dominance are actually drivers and insurance. Naturally, drivers want to make enough money and hopefully more money each year as inflation grows. But Uber wants more supply - which improves customer experiences but creates more competition for drivers. If drivers pool together to strike, get unionized, or have legislation passed to guarantee minimum wage, etc. all of them will increase Uber's prices to consumers. Consumers are price sensitive to ride hailing, so volumes would fall and hurt Uber's business. Uber takes a standard cut and they're profitable today without raising prices; it's likely that Uber will continue to keep its cut low to increase gross bookings. Insurance is another threat - today insurers are price gouging the likes of Uber and the cost is impacted by several hundred basis points because of this. Uber has already recognized this threat and has started collecting data to use as proof to negotiate for lower auto insurance. We should start seeing some improvements in the next few quarters. Low insurance costs mean lower Uber ride prices which will also increase volumes. **AV is a boon, not a bane** Unlike drivers, AVs do not need to get paid a minimum wage to survive. If or when AVs become the norm, Uber will be able to offer significantly cheaper Uber ride prices and increase ride volumes significantly. Imagine if a ride costs $5 instead of $30 today - how many more rides will be happening? I reckon it'd be 10x or more. Likewise, if AVs are able to match Tesla's ambition of 100x passenger safety, then insurance costs will naturally come down, which is another tailwind for Uber. **Why Waymo and Tesla won't threaten Uber** Waymo and Tesla are the frontrunners of AV. But they don't operate and optimize fleets. There is a lot of unsexy work behind the fleet management business. The biggest one is customer support. Google is definitely not known to offer any kind of meaningful customer support. As for Tesla, their ambition is to transform the world's ICE fleet to electric vehicles. They'd likely want to focus on scaling manufacturing and license their AV technology so they can expand quickly throughout the world. Plus, China has promising AV technology as well. So the AV industry isn't a winner take all - which means that they'll likely find it more advantageous to work with a seasoned partner like Uber - who isn't greedy and just wants to maintain their low cost pricing while increasing rideshare volumes - to scale their AV fleet business.

m48as2b,"You don't think AI software has potential? Whats the point of NVDA, AMD, MRVL, AVGO, SMCI, MU, etc... All that hardware is being built for something. Namely AI software. Whatever software program wins the AI wars comes out on top. Some people think CRM will win, some people think SNOW will win, etc... For what its worth out of these picks my money is invested in PLTR, AVGO, and NVDA because I have the most faith those will be the winners long term.

Berkshire can't invest as you or I do, because $100 million invested in say, Baytex Energy, wouldn't have significant impact on Berkshire's returns. Were I Buffett, I'd simply admit defeat.

m417v91,"What’s your specialty? Can you side step into chart review or medical writing/editing? There is huge demand for both although I hear the former can be emotionally draining depending on who you work for. Or instruction? You’re not stuck in ‘traditional’ patient care. I used to be an obgyn nurse, now I teach mostly A&P and qualitative research skills. It drove me crazy the docs would complain (oh I should have gone to dental school) but then getting ‘out of the rat race’ as you put it = dropping OB lol. Other opportunities weren’t even on their radar, even one I scribed for who f-ing hated her life. It’s a pay cut to side step (although still very well paid) and they were all very open about resenting the time/money the put into their education and feeling owed a certain amount of money for it. Which I don’t disagree with that but when you’re at the point that you f-ing hate your life it’s like dude take a pay cut Kim!!

For some reason they were not able to maintain cash flow even as their Revenue continues to grow. That probably scared some investors into selling. But the cash flow did pop back up. It looks like their cost of revenue went down but their operating expenses crept up 10%. They also paid off $2B of debt according to their cashflow statement is right around it's average.

1gqnk94,"Holding Russell 1000 Index + VTI?. My former advisor bought a little under $100k in three mutual funds which track the Russell 1000 large, mid and small cap. I’ve since taken over my own investing and I have been buying only VTI and VXUS shares. I’ve been tempted to sell the shares held in the Russell 1000 and dump it into VTI and VXUS. It’d be around a $2.5k tax payout if I sell. On the other hand it wouldn’t be the worst idea to just hold onto the Russell 1000 holdings even if I don’t plan to buy additional shares as it historically performs similar to VTI. The expense ratio is also low 0.09 vs VTI 0.03, so the difference is fairly minimal.

1gqmvgy,"US Interest rates now much too high for predicted Trump Economy. It's pretty evident now that the Fed (Powell) undershot the expected growth in US GDP and thus the expected real inflation rate decline by quite a lot. Powell had predicted 100bp cuts would be enough, but turns out probably need closer to 150bp cuts. I'd have agreed with 100bp cuts until the election, but things are changing fast. The market has undone all of Powell's work, AGAIN, as it has done 2-times in the last 4 years. Which I think shows that Powell and his team of governors are complete amateurs. Japan's novice Banker Kazuo Ueda didn't help matters. I was expecting Japan to raise rates 25bp based on the Yen's value versus oil and the allowance by the VIX, but instead they got too scared of the ""unwinding carry trade"" to raise rates and they said as much. Now the Yen has utterly collapsed and put Japan back into recession territory since the country is 100% dependent upon oil imports. Oil will not decline much more given that global growth is intact, especially the US, and that there is limited oil supply growth. There's a net decline in global oil production and this will drive oil prices even higher, forcing Japan. Japan will be forced to raise rates which will force US Dollar yields even lower, aka compressing the Yen-carry-trade, because to cover their losses on a rising Yen-yield, dollar-holders will be forced to sell which lowers US-yields. Somewhere there's a happy medium with expected US and global GDP growth, that's where I think the 150bp cuts in US and a further 50bp hikes in Japan make sense over the next 1 to 2 years. The fact it hasn't happened yet has provided the greatest opportunity to buy into bonds, gold, bitcoin, oil, and a lot of others. The ""losers"" of this outcome will be the SPY/SPX in general, the QQQ, equities and etc. It doesn't mean we won't continue to see good returns in the equities market, but it may slow down here, or even top out. We may get a sideways to down market for most of 2025. Or the upside will be muted by the return on bonds.",post,ValueInvesting,2024-11-13 20:36:58,0.051121074706315994,QQQ,1,2080,373,20,2,2024-11-13,negative,-0.7061242684721947,0.10729489475488663,0.07928598672151566,0.8134191632270813,neutral,-0.3735727537423372,0.011499417945742607,0.6034283638000488,0.38507217168807983,negative,-0.9972808008315042,0.0009266490815207362,0.0008658906444907188,0.9982074499130249,negative,-0.7331079710274935,0.017237676307559013,0.23241667449474335,0.7503456473350525,-0.7025214485183824,0.06534627841391157,0.25562918146000385,2024-11-13

Mainly though, our international exposure was through target date funds. We wanted to move away from TDFs overall , the glide path currently had us at around $20 for every $100 in bonds and another $33 odd in international - with no way to really control it. We initially though of selling the TDFs and buying equivalent tickers with a slightly adjusted split, but the standalone international options in our 401k plan were not good or even similar to something like VXUS, with higher expense ratios as well - so we ended up selling the TDF, moving 20% to bonds and the rest to US equities.

m3y6cg1,"I think it works best as a fantasy - as you are working your soul sucking corporate job, it may feel good to think to yourself ""I don't need this, I could quit and support myself on x \_\_\_ (insert lower paying job)"". But, don't actually do that. It's a grass is greener thing, and needing a $20k/yr job is going to suck a lot worse than your $150k/yr corporate job. If, once you reach actual\_FI and stop working you find yourself bored and think maybe working at a coffee shop 2 days a week might be just enough to keep busy, fine, go ahead and try it out. But I would get to actual\_FI first so you never actually need that income, I think most people will find the coffee shop manager just as much a pain in the ass as your corporate job manager, and for a lot less money.",comment,financialindependence,2024-12-26 23:19:04,0.05788271129131317,TFSA,1,781,152,23,3,2024-12-26,neutral,-0.3777208551764488,0.03654114156961441,0.5491968393325806,0.41426199674606323,negative,-0.7529764026403427,0.039588943123817444,0.1678457409143448,0.7925653457641602,neutral,-0.027896687388420105,0.013909555971622467,0.9442842602729797,0.04180624336004257,negative,-0.4192390963435173,0.1147725060582161,0.3512159287929535,0.5340116024017334,-0.39445826038718224,0.08793229189595575,0.2965337955376347,2024-12-26

My daughter's college fund is 100% index fund, she's 3 so we'll keep it that way, no individual stocks in that for the most part. I'm about 6 years into investing with another 15-18 to go so I'll likely be fairly aggressive for the next 5 years because I'm in the period where growth is the most critical, I don't have that much wealth to conserve.

m483u3h,"> the OP said he wanted a peace of mind and not worry about the prospect of regime change in DC and the potential impact on his payment plan. Did they? I don't see that in any of their comments. Here is the listed priority I see > [I would like to maintain a healthy emergency fund but not sure if I should be doing more than just a HYSA. I’d like to continue save to upgrade my living situation to a newer home in the next 5-7 years but also worry about not investing enough for retirement.]( Based on this, his priorities in no particular order are healthy emergency fund, down payment, retirement funds. I do not see debt pay down as a priority, I do not see peace of mind for no debt, I do not see anything about the regime change in DC. OP could take the extra funds, throw it in an HYSA or money market, get a guaranteed 4.4% through vanguard. That also keeps the funds liquid, and [liquidity has value]( 100k in cash + 100k in debt is better than 0 in both assuming the interest rates balance. With the first option, the individual can always choose to reach the second option. Once the second option is chosen, it is chosen and it is difficult going back. The flexibility is gone. With the HYSA and money market option, OP gets higher returns leading to a higher net worth. If DC raises the student loans or the offered rates on HYSA drop, OP has the option to change their approach. If market conditions remain favorable, the extra funds allow them to prioritize the If we strictly look at the numbers, right now HYSA and MM are far better than paying off the student loan. Even if DC makes a major change, the right action at this moment in time is not to pay them off.",comment,financialindependence,2024-12-28 18:08:35,0.04722010716795921,OP,1,1901,320,18,5,2024-12-28,neutral,0.0435398705303669,0.07517722994089127,0.8931854367256165,0.03163735941052437,neutral,-0.000485550903249532,0.00013790029333904386,0.9992386102676392,0.0006234511965885758,neutral,0.0012776915536960587,0.0014585264725610614,0.9983606934547424,0.0001808349188650027,neutral,-0.35390210151672363,0.03226315975189209,0.5815715789794922,0.3861652612686157,-0.07739252258397755,0.034395291943831535,0.18545967740679248,2024-12-28

m483khs,"AI has already showcased its potential, delivering tangible results. In contrast, quantum technology largely remains a field of imagination and speculation at this stage.

m3zdzw9,"They have been doing the beta testing for a few weeks for the original roll out plan. Which from what I understand is starting with more of a poor connection/emergency response situation and going from there. Not personally on T-Mobile or know anyone on them because of how bad their service is in my area. Did know someone who used it during the hurricane, said the connection worked well. But he was also saving power he was not on his phone 24/7 for me to ask all my technical questions. There is also the fact that AST is having to go to SpaceX to get their satellites launched because of how much the rest of the competition has mangled their rocket programs. My point is this, I don't know that I have seen enough out of ASTS that says ""we are still in the front"", that they may have actually been distracted and as no one was paying attention, Musk got an extensive network in place. So now it is the matter of what matters more. 5G but not enough coverage, coverage and probably needing to catch up on some of the call quality.

m40ml6o,"This bullshit again. Due to the acquisition of Xilinx, AMD is amortising acquired goodwill, and will do so for quite a while. This has the effect of reducing profits, giving a generally false impression of the actual financial performance of AMD. Goodwill is not amortisable in the majority of countries and financial reporting standards, however in the US it is amortised. Under other financial reporting standards, intangibles acquired as part of an acquisition are amortised, excluding goodwill, which is not amortised but is subject to the same impairment tests as other purchased intangibles. This is one of the reasons why AMD produces non-GAAP figures in their financial reports - it normalises for the impact of the amortisation of goodwill (among other things). Currently amortisation of goodwill of acquisition related intangibles (including goodwill) is $600m-ish per quarter. Not all of this will be goodwill, however I imagine a significant chunk of this will be.",comment,stocks,2024-12-27 11:09:57,0.012866484001278877,AMD,1,982,153,11,4,2024-12-27,neutral,-0.09801646694540977,0.05348930135369301,0.7950049042701721,0.15150576829910278,neutral,-0.02645791978284251,0.00012727543071378022,0.9732875823974609,0.02658519521355629,negative,-0.996944168698974,0.0004939044592902064,0.0020679470617324114,0.9974380731582642,negative,-0.6352645885199308,0.01994548924267292,0.32484444975852966,0.6552100777626038,-0.43917078598678927,0.2120940350616547,0.46053668155930283,2024-12-27

m3zjy9z,"You make all very fantastic points. This is one of those thread where I think people need to look at the logic. Look at the up and down votes, and double check it against the news. >The stock has a cult like following, so you are getting very biased answers from those who want it to succeed. I will probably get downvoted to oblivion for this. I am getting the downvote. So hopefully they leave you alone. I got hate for pointing out Starlight got FCC approval. (It's public record, tons of news stories). I get wanting it to be successful, but I also strongly believe if you are going to invest in technology you should understand what it is for and what the competition is, because it can change very quickly. >Also ASTS claims first mover advantage, but they seem to have lost that as SpaceX has now fully deployed their first orbital shell and has worldwide coverage. Meanwhile ASTS is still waiting on a permit from the FCC for about 9 months now! They did, for quite some time. The same was true for Boeing, who was another one sitting at the top and who has fallen. ASTS is at risk of that. Contracts are only good if there is actually service to provide. I have one of the companies ""signed up for service"" with ASTS. It is not an option to get, so they are not delivering. But realistically, if they can't deliver or if he gets an upgraded network, they lost when it was completely theirs to win. That is exactly the thing, stock research absolutely needs to look at who is the power hungry company nipping at the heels, that will take someone down given the chance. None of them have been able to explain how ASTS is going to get back ahead from falling behind.",comment,stocks,2024-12-27 04:41:23,0.011390002444386482,ASTS,1,1686,311,4,4,2024-12-27,neutral,-0.0313703715801239,0.1290719360113144,0.7104857563972473,0.1604423075914383,neutral,0.3369364652899094,0.3376568555831909,0.6616227030754089,0.0007203902932815254,neutral,0.4711566441692412,0.47648775577545166,0.5181810855865479,0.00533111160621047,neutral,0.08979155123233795,0.31076136231422424,0.4682687819004059,0.2209698110818863,0.21662857227784116,0.052283211521373496,0.22865522412876005,2024-12-27

It’s definitely been a wild ride with a lot of ups and downs, and I’ve learned a lot along the way. Now, I’m at a bit of a crossroads. Part of me is wondering if I should start scaling back, diversify into something more stable, or even take a break from trading altogether. But another part of me feels like there’s still room to grow if I keep pushing. If you were in my shoes, what would you do next? Would you shift to a more conservative strategy, take some profits off the table, or try something else entirely? I’m open to all thoughts and would love to hear about any similar experiences. Thanks in advance for the input – **I appreciate any advice you guys have to offer!** Also, feel free to ask any questions!",post,investing,2024-11-14 18:49:18,0.05519689992070198,TSLA,6,1527,270,18,3,2024-11-14,neutral,0.0943557657301426,0.1182267889380455,0.8579021692276001,0.02387102320790291,neutral,-0.010835327673703432,0.002620710525661707,0.9839232563972473,0.013456038199365139,positive,0.9987117066339124,0.9989546537399292,0.0008023278205655515,0.0002429471060167998,positive,0.7236455790698528,0.7320200800895691,0.2596054673194885,0.008374501019716263,0.4514694309400511,0.23826994121131614,0.48812902107057327,2024-11-14

1gtrwyf,"Is Robinhood's Roth IRA and its 1% match a good retirement investment?. Now, before everyone runs to the comments to explain how much they loathe Robinhood, I'm just looking for some honest reasons as to why you believe opening a Roth IRA with Robinhood is/is not a smart investment. We all know why Robinhood has such a bad reputation, especially since the GME fiasco. I'm purely asking out of curiosity, I'm opening a Roth with Vanguard but I have a few friends with Roths through Robinhood and they're perfectly happy with it.

1gtrdjh,"My research and direction of ABNB. Hi Everyone, Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me. I am from the tech industry with major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed righaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green. So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach. I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets. I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way. I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation. Based on my analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term. As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below. As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov). **Financial and Fundamental Analysis:** **1. Valuation Concerns:** Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment. **2. Slowing Growth:** While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions. **3. Regulatory Headwinds:** Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets. **4. Increasing Competition:** The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position. **5.

She is also pulling a $4,000/month pension and has $150K in a savings. I’ve asked her advisor to dial back her stock market exposure to only 55% in the IRA.

m3y55s3,"If I were looking for yield I would agree with you, but we’re talking about liquidity. I don’t want an asset that is remotely volatile. I don’t want to have to potentially eat losses and sell bonds or BND at a loss when I need cash. I want to be able to convert the asset to cash with little to no loss of principal, quickly. The rate of return on my liquidity is tertiary. The most important things when it comes to liquidity is 1) my ability to sell the asset quickly for cash, and 2) little to no risk of principal loss.

m3xqe5n,"Its hard to decide whats ""fair"" as its not our relationship. Lots of decisions were made and I hope lots of conversations were had along with way such as who decided to move? what was the discussion when she left work the second time? I was the major breadwinner in our family and I retired early and my honey kept working, he was the one that wanted more, he was the one that hadn't saved (we met in our 40s and he had blown thru hundreds of thousands inheritance), ie for us that was ""fair"" with a time limit of 5 additional years. We then made a budget and lived off that budget of what life would look like without extra income coming in.. and well he said it was fine, then lived it and was like, never mind I'll work another year or two. The several physicians I know work at hospitals and they have the ability to reduce their hours rather significantly and still make a decent living. If its just the workplace I'd be surprised you can't find other options that make it more comfortable. The big thing is being on the same page, especially with kids. Its not just the paying for college, its the what if the kids don't launch and end up staying at home for several years, do you plan to help them out? What does family vacations look like as they become adults? What happens when the kids move away, do you have budget to go travel and see them? If they can't afford to fly home for the holidays would you want to help them out? Are you planning to help with the weddings? grandkids? I just have nieces/nephews and end up spending a few thousand a year to go visit them and spend time as they are not close and I don't want to miss out on their lives.",comment,financialindependence,2024-12-26 21:44:18,0.04569687694311142,TFSA,1,1672,319,21,3,2024-12-26,neutral,-0.11176082864403725,0.04112520441412926,0.8059887886047363,0.1528860330581665,neutral,-0.00767961866222322,0.0008800823707133532,0.9905602335929871,0.008559701032936573,neutral,0.00015791872283443809,0.00023222251911647618,0.9996935129165649,7.430379628203809e-05,neutral,-0.16193774715065956,0.06134368106722832,0.7153749465942383,0.22328142821788788,-0.0703050689335214,0.006334035793854737,0.07958665587807254,2024-12-26

m4831bb,it's not that as much as there are certain requirements of risk management as a professional for setting up portfolios. No YOLOs or being way too heavy into a single stock. In my personal successes as an investor (only been at it about 5 years) my biggest wins have come from being concentrated into a small handful of stocks. Professionals don't get 10 baggers like retailers do. They also don't go to $0 as often either. In 2023 I was primarily invested in 2 stocks. one of them I traded in a $20 range all year long and sold CC (long term holder of both stocks btw). Was up about 150% on the year. You can't do that as a pro. This year I'm up about 80% and have been as up high as ~125% and down as much as 11%. Again numbers you aren't seeing as a pro. My risk tolerance is HIGH and I can get burned is the difference.

First we have to assume our desired return on investment is over 10% right? If it was 10%, we'd just invest in the SP500 and be done.

Let's review our assumptions real quick: Current PE 400 Future PE 40 Years 10 Desired rate of return 15% I punch that into my calculator and it says that PLTR has to grow their earnings at 45% a year for the next 10 years to give me a 15% return. That's how massive of a headwind the PE deflation is. Which isn't to say PLTR is a bad investment. I have no idea. (Well I have an inkling it's not :) ) 45% a year growth is perfectly possible. But I'd have to understand the company and the industry to make that type of determination. For example, if you do the math, 1.45\^10 = \~40. I look up PLTR's earnings real quick and it's only 210 million. Times that by 40 and it's about 8.5 billion. Is it crazy that a company could go from from basically no profit to 8.5 billion in 10 years? Not really. But it's also the kind of bet I dont want to make. In the AAPL example, we had two likely things working for us. Earnings growth and multiple expansion. We just needed 7% earnings growth and for the multiple to double from 10 to 20 to get a 15% rate of return. Problem with investing in companies like PLTR, is that if they start missing growth estimates, then the PE starts dropping too, so you get double barreled \*\*negative\*\* growth.

m482wl5,"It's important to appreciate that no one really knows what theyre doing. We're trying to predict the future here. There's really no such thing as accuracy. It's more about just applying common sense to find opportunities. And the opportunities should really jump off the page. Let's take AAPL as an example. If you go back to 2015-2016ish you had an amazing company trading at 10x earnings after discounting their net cash. It wasn't that hard to imagine a world where that multiple would expand. You didn't really have to know if it was going to expand to 20, 30, or 40. You also could assume that earnings were going to grow over the next 10 years. They've doubled over the last 10 years or so, which using the rule of 72, means theyve grown at about 7% a year. Rule of 72 -> Divide the number of years into 72 to find the growth rate. 72 / 10 years = 7% growth or 72 / 7% growth = 10 years So back in 2015, you could have made two reasonable assumptions. 1) The price multiple would double 2) The earnings would double That gives you what I like to call, double barreled growth. And that's my favorite type of investment. An amazing company trading at a low price. It's hard to miss on those. What becomes really tricky is when people start trying to guess where the multiple will \*\*fall\*\* to. I guess PLTR is the latest meme stock. I just looked it up. 400 PE. A lot of value investors will look at that and go, well that's insane. It's overvalued. Maybe. Netflix was once 200 PE. I wouldnt having a time machine and buying it. Same with AMZN, etc. But the problem with that type of investing is where will the PE deflate to? We can all assume PLTR will grow its earnings over the next 10 years. That doesn't take any special intuition, but most investors just stop there with their analysis. ""I think this company will be successful"" or ""This company will sell a lot of widgets"" and they buy it. That's naive. Because we know that the 400 PE has to converge to the market average over time. It may be like Amazon and take \*\*decades\*\* to reach the market average, but eventually it has to converge to it. It can't stay at 400 forever and it's nearly impossible for it to expand over any long period of time.",comment,ValueInvesting,2024-12-28 18:03:27,0.05291479825973511,PLTR,3,2240,414,18,5,2024-12-28,neutral,0.06641280092298985,0.09593342989683151,0.8745459318161011,0.029520628973841667,neutral,0.13878467335598543,0.13892953097820282,0.8609256148338318,0.00014485762221738696,positive,0.9983289084775606,0.9985248446464539,0.0012792858760803938,0.0001959361688932404,neutral,0.13978147506713867,0.2577783167362213,0.6242249011993408,0.11799684166908264,0.33582696445591864,0.19625077191206652,0.44300199989623806,2024-12-28
