leafhog,1731451163,lwtojln,1gpqp30,2,"At a 4% withdrawal rate, $1m gets him $40k a year. Withdrawing from home equity is difficult and incurs addition interest expenses. If he can live on $40k/year then he and retire today.

If he is saying he doesn't have enough to retire at 65 today... that is more difficult to gauge. It depends on his rate of return and how much he continues to save.

If you are telling him to let up on the gas and start saving less... well, I think you are wrong.

He should save and invest as aggressively as he can. Put it in a nice low cost index fund and let it sit. If he gets to a point where he feels comfortable retiring then he can retire. He may find himself forced into retirement before that then.

I think he is doing alright towards retirement. It could be better. It could be worse.",investing

TonyzTone,1731456659,lwu4gpu,1gpllz1,1,"Right, but neither of those are industries like Apple in 2003.

In 2003, Apple was a niche home computing company, with even smaller B2B division. It had resurrected its profitabilty by reducing its offerings, not really expanding. 

But... it had recently just released the iPod (a novel, but lackluster product) and then the iTunes Store. Suddenly, it had a cash cow that revolutionized the game and went on to develop the market that would become dominated by the iPod. Then the iPhone and App Store shortly afterwards.

It's hard to say in 2003, that Apple would've been that behemoth and back then someone on a thread like this would be saying something like ""look at what the company has produced in the last 23 years: lackluster performance.""

So, in a way, for the closest comparison we should be looking at a company that's about 25-30 years old, IPOed about 20 years ago, and has just recently returned to profitability and released new products within the last 2 or so years, that might just go on to develop a whole new market space.",investing

With bonds you are guaranteeing bad performance. 4.2% yield on 10 year bonds? Pathetic. Stocks average 10% long term. Someone 100% equities will absolutely obliterate someone with a significant amount of bonds. And now the Fed will not hesitate to drop interest rates when a market crash happens. That means stocks recover quickly and bonds yield sucks even more.

This isn’t 1980 or 1990. When bonds were yielding juicy 7% guaranteed yields. The new normal for bonds is 4% which is absolutely crap.

And I’m not saying you shouldn’t have some emergency funds. Early in retirement I recommended 1-2 years worth of expenses in liquid. That would be HYSA which yields 4.5%. At this moment there is literally no reason to buy bonds",investing
Midnightsun24c,1731472479,lwvb5be,1gpr1ur,1,"You could just do the Schwab index Target Date Funds. It's mostly stocks early on and then leans into fixed income later on.


 Or you could do 80-100% VT (world index fund) and 0-20% BND for US bonds or BNDW for world bonds. 


AOA and AVDE are examples of a low cost all in fund that don't change their allocation over time. AOA is 80% global stocks and 20% bonds straight up and forever.  AVDE is a small cap value tilted fund of funds but mostly sticks to the low-cost broad market exposure with that factor tilt. Factor exposure is a whole other can of worms that may or may not be worth getting into.

Or you could just stick with the robo advisor, that's likely going to do OK, basically the same thing you should be doing anyway but 8% cash is kind of high for a retirement account especially with so long to compound. 

Any of these options highlights varying degrees of simplicity and automation, but I like them because , and to be honest, for most people, the more simple the method, the better.  Less likely to tinker and make active choices/mistakes if whatever you have is mostly set it and forget it.",investing

ron_leflore,1713126255,kzkzdwm,1c3wth8,3,"The simple answer is to use angel list.  On angel list, you aren't actually an angel investor, you give money to an angel investor and they invest it.

Technically, what you are buying into is a partnership (a special purpose vehicle) that is governed by a bunch of rules, but mostly just exists to own shares in a startup.  The head of that partnership is the actual angel investor and they will get a cut (usually 20%) of any gains you make.  Minimum investments in these are usually in the $1k to $10k range and technically they are only open to accredited investors.

They also have a rolling funds (https://www.angellist.com/rolling) which are more like a ETF.  You give the angel investor so much every quarter, and they pick the investments.  I avoid these becasue of the fee structure and lack of ability to choose particular investments.

People think that you won't see the good companies on angel list, but it's not true.  First, these are mostly early stage companies raising less than $1 million.  That's too small for the big famous venture capital firms.  Those guys come in later, when they are raising $10 million +.",investing

DReddit111,1713136491,kzlqajx,1c3w6jc,3,"I been buying treasuries from Vanguard. It’s pretty easy. You go on their web site and pick what you want to  buy in thousand dollar increments. I buy at auctions direct from the government through Vanguard,  because the money is in an IRA and you can’t do those through Treasury Direct. Seems like buying from third parties and not direct from the government , the quantities you have to buy can be pretty high, like 100k at a time, so I do the treasury auctions instead because I  want to buy much smaller amounts.

I wouldn’t buy treasuries directly unless you’re absolutely sure you want to hold them to maturity. In that case the interest goes direct into your brokerage account and then the principal at maturity. I always hold to maturity and never sell, but I think the problem selling is similar to buying. At least from Vanguard you have to sell a lot at once usually,  more than I have usually.

Auctions are usually once a month for each term, a bunch under a year, then 2 year, 3 year, 5 year, 10 year, 20 year and 30 year. You look at Treasury Direct for the next upcoming auction and then put in the order with your broker a few days before that date. You don’t actually bid in the auctions, only the big banks do that. You get the same rate that they bid more or less, but you don’t know the exact rate until the auction is over.",investing

It's a bank holding company across the American West, based out of Washington with a market share in the PNW that looks to slot in right below the major nationals. They merged last year with another regional, Umpqua Holdings Corp. The quick and dirty:

* Price today: $20.58
* Book value per common share: $23.68
* Tangible book value per common share: $16.08
* Tier-1 Capital Holdings: 9.8%
* ROA: 0.92% today but consistently hovering around 1%
* ROE: 9.89 today but in the teens over the past few years
* ROI: 5.18%
* P/B: 0.87
* P/E (if you care with a bank): 8.82
* Net charge-off: 0.47% (up with the general trend right now, but comparable to WFC at 0.50%)

Population and income growth in its markets (WA, CA, ID, OR, UT, AZ, CO) is expected to slightly outperform the national trend in coming years. Its numbers are slightly down lately but seemingly due to more general factors affecting banking/the economy as a whole. 

Looking at its plummeting P/B ratio over the last 4-5 years during a period of expansion, it just feels a little... unloved.

What makes their products unique? Why buy them and invest in them over another company? There's almost no reasons I see to use their product, and if you can't imagine yourself using the company or product of the company, then why would you buy that company? You wouldn't invest into something when you think a competitor is objectively better. 

A simple Google search provides a big reason the stock has dropped. 35% of PERI revenue comes from Bing, and when Bing changed these rules, it led to massive declines in future revenue. If one customer canceling your contract leads to a 35% revenue drop, that is an extremely large risk, and that's not something you can just account for in a DCF. That's just too hard for anyone to invest in, which is why the stock is cratering. Hell, they're an Israeli company, and if western companies like Google and Microsoft start to get pressured to cut off Israel due to the conflict in Gaza, that company is dead.

UCACashFlow,1715964090,l4h7mu4,1cg84cm,2,"Coming back to this post, as I don’t see any updates in the subreddit.

You see that local grinders have all their needs met? Somewhat older news, but that despite local harvests anticipated to be down 30% YOY out of the region, local grinders were prioritized and are well covered and will have no shortage of beans, despite the general drop in production. 

Hershey is one that would be in that group of local grinders. So this gives more confidence that this noise will not be significant.

Thinking about the qualitative and psychological factors associated with how the company operates and conduct business, and when said factors act and combine together, create a very strong force or hedge against what’s going on (sort of a lalapalooza scenario):

- HSY requires wholesalers to pay a living wage premium that goes back to the producers/farmers. While the local governments decide what farmers get paid, and there’s corruption and issues in that part, Hershey regularly petitions for better conditions and pay, and have dumped hundreds of millions into improving the communities of producers with schools for the children, clean water wells, sustainable farm management practices, etc. 

All of this takes advantage of the reciprocity principle in psychology, the principle that when one party is treated favorably, humans tend to reciprocate with another positive action or favor. 

Given grinders were given priority, this is clearly the results of their efforts of improving the regions paying off. Even though it’s likely the government that allowed for the prioritization, it’s still a reciprocal act. You take care of the hand that feeds you. This is a powerful concept that shows the strength of the company’s supplier relationships.

You also have other regions like Brazil who are now planting more cacao crops to take advantage of the temporary spike in price. And this will also put downward pressure on the supply side of the equation. More producing regions will try and take a piece of the pie until a high price can no longer be exploited because everyone participating increases overall supplies. Companies such as HSY are also pushing for diversification in producing regions and that will just always be a continuing effort in the background.  Sure it takes 3-5 years to see cocoa produced but this all bodes well for the future.

Anyways, just more info coming through that validates my thesis that the company will get through this just fine. And is better equipped to handle this today than they were in 1977. 

I believe with the implementation of the S/4 system, and the efficiencies that will bring to the company’s distribution and preparation process cannot be understated. And then the further efficiencies from the AAA initiative that will benefit in future years will mean more earnings growth. And then once cocoa falls, all those price pack architecture and price changes will come to margin. 

I’m very excited to see all these factors combine and provide strong earnings growth in future years and decades. Sure it’s possible we have an inflationary recession between now and 2030, given we are in the “hangover” phase of monetary base led inflation. Especially if the Fed doesn’t pull of their soft landing miracle (would be the first time in history we don’t see an inflationary recession), but that won’t matter in the long run either, and honestly could just provide more buying opportunities if the market was depressed enough.",ValueInvesting

I would buy more ideas if I found any worthwhile, but generally you have to truly understand/have some profound insight to justify owning the super concentrated 5 stocks for me to own 20% in each of the 5 best ideas I have.

Since I lack the number of ideas and expertise to concentrate that heavy, I invest broadly diversified, with only one investment I believe (right now) represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

The big realization is that I might be smart, but I am competing against thousands of people just as smart, working with algorithms, A.I. models, focusing fulltime and with insider information I simply can't compete with.

I like zts, i am also aware that a few years ago, there were like 10-15 shops in a street near me catering to pets, now less than half are still around.

The question is, did the go-back-to-office movement kill the shops? If so, does it affect zts? 

The recent q1 results doesn’t seem so, but the normalisation process may affect different industries, for example, Makers of Jack Daniel’s, General Foods and Lulu lemon did well during pandemic in 2020, 2021 and 2022, and started to get affected by the GBTOffice movement in 2023 and we all saw a large impact last year. 

Pre-pandemic, zts grew revenue 5% a year from 2014-2019. During pandemic years, 2020 to -TTM, revenue increased to 6.9-8% a year but earnings dropped from 20+% to under 15%.

- last interim results announced last week shows a shrinking of FCF during to shrinking margins. 

- but they went to take on debt to buy back shares. And increased their d/e from a target of 0.5 to 1.4. 

- which in turn adds pressure to the dividend payment ( current dividend yield is around 5.5% )

- the new creative director’s vision is taking longer to be realised, and they announced that they are refocusing on heritage wear (trench coats)

- and even their wholesale partners, who are responsible for stuffing the factory outlets and cheapening their brands, are also cognizant about the decline even they have cut back on the business by 25%

Ford, GM, and pretty much every other EV maker is seeing the exact same pullback in the exact same groups of people. Now how did old Elon convince democrats that they shouldn’t buy rivian? How did he convince them they shouldn’t buy a VW ID series? He didn’t. 

For a tiny fraction of political extremists, Elon may be the root cause for avoiding Tesla. For the other 99.9% of consumers, high rates and competition in China have slowed EV sales everywhere. In the US, EV sales peaked in 2H last year and since then growth has slowed to basically 0. Since democrats were historically buying more EVs than independents or republicans, they have the largest proportional pullback. 

These Reddit comments sections are almost always full of bias on topics like this. Go back to when Netflix was cracking down on passwords. It’s thousands of anecdotes that people are cancelling their subscriptions, when in reality Netflix was seeing record user sign ups. 

Go back to when Facebook was burning billions on the metaverse. It was hundreds of anecdotal comments that they never used Facebook anymore and it was a dying app when in reality all of their usage statistics were at all time highs. 

Elon is no different. The hundreds who hate him are the ones who post on these threads, while the millions of people who don’t care and just want a cheap vehicle are simply waiting for rates to come down and more EV chargers to be built.

In your example you buy a $485 1/16/2026 Put for $15.50 per share. You are immediately handicapping your upside by 2.8%. If the market goes up 5% you made 2.2% in that time. If the market goes up 2%, you lose 0.8%, etc.

If VOO goes down moderately but not to your strike price ($485) you get $0 for the option and lost money in the market. So a 2% drop for VOO means a 4.8% drop for you. Your hedge only begins to work once VOO is below $485. You only begin effectively hedging at $471.20.

I would advise a fund if you’re looking for an 8% return. Buying a fund means you own a part of all the companies listed on the stock market. The stock market goes up over time, so the fund goes up too. I would strongly advise not to pick individual stocks yourself. You will probably lose your investment.

You want to have most of not all of your investment in shares and not bonds if you are young. They have higher returns. When you get to 40+, perhaps consider bonds as they’re generally considered less risky.

ricci3469,1731539828,lwzzmzp,1gq9jln,1,"Does this count as a capital loss? (Stock Market Newbie who got RSU's here)


So, I was granted $5k in RSU's earlier this year when my company went public, a congratulations gift I guess. I was confused at the time, because I'd never heard of getting a dollar number amount of shares, just a set number of shares. So I figured that however many shares that ended up being, would be based on their value when they vested on January 1st 2025. (I'm in a lockup period until Feb 8th).

  
Well now, when I logged into Shareworks for the first time today to see what was going on with my RSU's since the vesting day is coming up, not only is there a set number of shares in the account, but the selling price of each share has more than HALFED the price at IPO. So my supposed $5k gift from the company, is now only \~$2200, AND DROPPING, before they've even vested.

  
I'm literally so upset, since I was planning on selling those stocks as soon as I got them (because obviously, I know absolutely nothing about the stock market and honestly, want nothing to do with it lol), and putting that towards a cross-country move with my husband. Really freaking wish they had just given me a $5k bonus outright lol

  
All that preamble though is mainly to ask, will this at least count as a capital loss if I sell after the blackout period ends so I can at least get an upside on my tax return? I know capital loss is considered when a stock is sold for less than it was purchased, so will the purchase price at least be what it was at IPO when I was given the  ""award""? Or is the purchase price going to be the price of the stocks when they vest? Please help I'm such an idiot when it comes to this shit.",investing

Nobody really expected Apple to do much of anything because they were completely bailed out by Microsoft and the only reason Microsoft bailed them out was to help against all of the antitrust issues that they were having.

strait_lines,1715964238,l4h820d,1ctwunm,1,"The Chinese government has a program where they are paying foreigners to make social media posts that promote China. 

A lot of the one's I've seen, pick the best of what China has and compare it against the worst of what the US has. 

The reality of it all is, China does have some things they do better, but they also have things they do much worse. 

My experiences in my multiple visits to mainland china:

Subways are very clean and assuming you aren't handicap or traveling with small children, very good. The downside, are things like, stairs to the handicap elevator, or elevators that are broken or shut down. 

food and housing are pretty low cost there, but you could also say that of many other countries. 

medical care there: you need to pay up front or you won't get any medical care. you also need to plan on at least an entire day for any type of medical care, you'll be waiting around through most of it. While the cost is close to what you would pay with insurance in the US, US health care is far faster and has far more convenient options. I had one of my kids with me who needed a nebulizer in china, which resulted in an entire week consumed mostly at the hospital, where the same thing in the US gets you a portable nebulizer and a prescription and you have more time not waiting around in the hospital. 

city cleanliness: much like the US, it really depends on where you are. I've seen large groups of rats moving around in the down town financial districts of Guangzhou before, but I've also seen similar in NY. China when you get out of the cities, you see a lot more poverty, unmaintained roads, and things like that, you don't have the suburban areas  like what you think of in the US, though I've seen similar in countries other than China as well. 

Homelessness I do thing asia in general has an edge on the US in this. Partially due to culture and closeness of family, but also, at least in china, because they are pretty good about grabbing up people with mental problems and institutionalizing them, and most asian countries have very severe laws around drugs. between those factors, you do see homeless in China, just not very many, and nowhere near the scale you see in some US cities.",ValueInvesting

Fun-Imagination-2488,1716021789,l4kq5pj,1cuk88d,2,"I think your friend sounds pretty rational, however…

Here are a few things for him to consider:


- Most great/prominent investors have acknowledged that your intelligence is less important than your ability to stomach making the obviously correct decision.  I believe Warren Buffet said something once about having super high intelligence with regard to analysis is almost useless if you don’t have the stomach for buying/holding through irrational price drops.  Plenty of smart people talked themselves out of buying Carvana at $4/share.  

- The reason many top hedge funds can’t beat the market isn’t because it is so difficult, or because they are not smart investors.  It is because their AUM is so high that they are unable to invest in the easy wins, which are smaller market cap companies.  Buffet has said as much as well.  You become a victim of your own success.  You might know of a $200m company that is almost certainly going to bring in market beating returns over the next 5 years, but if you’re managing >$1Bn dollars it doesn’t matter.  

- You can have worse analysis and still be a better investor.  Being an analyst is only part 1.  Have you ever read the post on this subreddit about Carvana being on a highway to bankruptcy? Half decent analysis, but not written by someone with the mind of a value investor.  There is a comment under that post asking OP, “At what price would you buy Carvana stock?” OP answered “There is no price.”  Which fundamentally illustrates that it doesn’t matter how good of an analyst you are when you don’t have the guts for value investing.

Every single stock in the world is worth purchasing at the right price.  If a company is 95% likely to go bankrupt and close its doors within 1 year, but the price upside within that year for a non-bankruptcy outcome is 100x, that is a +ev investment.  That’s not to mention when a good company lands in a position where the market has priced for failure even though failure is highly unlikely.",ValueInvesting

Revenue growth, gross profit growth, and EPS growth are not impressive and neither are their trends. The trend in their growth metrics doesn't indicate they are capitalizing on their moat, if they have one. The only thing that could indicate they are undervalued in a way that will lead to outperformance (return wise), is if they have entered a new market, have a new product, or have found some new efficiency that other people are overlooking because from a price and historical valuation perspective they don't seem to do well at these metric levels.

Previous-Display-593,1713669468,l0jpupm,1c97oam,-9,"I am bearish on Apple for a few reasons.

1. The limitations we are hitting with silicon chips are going to hit hardware oriented companies the most. Apple is the most hardware skewed big tech company. We are already seeing it in the latest generation of iPhone, where the main selling point was the Titanium case. The marketing department is grasping at straws. Their new ARM based desktop/laptop CPU's benefited heavily by buying up all of TSMC 5nm capacity, and milking the last drops of fabrication process advantage. That strategy is already over. Hardware is at the precipice, and everyone seems to be completely sleeping on this ENORMOUS elephant in the room.

*Sidenote: I have seen so many people argue that there are lots of other ways to get performance improvements out of CPU's without just shrinking transistor. If there were, they would be used already. There is no reason to save them for a rainy day. If Intel could stack chips and make 3D chips, or any other sort of strategy....they would have used it when they got stuck on 14nm 3 years ago.*

2. They are just the iPhone company. That is it. Look at the revenue breakdowns of big tech, Apple's is on of the worst for having all their egg's in a single basket. Their iPhone fort is also being attacked on all side by regulators.

3. Lastly, they are no longer an innovator but a follower. When they cancelled the Apple Car project, are reallocated those resources to AI, it was a shocking signal. What they essentially implied was ""We had this one strategy....it sucked. Now other tech companies have shown which way we should have gone, now lets pivot and chase the innovators"".

Apple is mediocre. Can their wads of cash be used to gain their former form...maybe.

Old habits die hard, and everyone is going to yell at me because AAPL has printed money for so long....but nothing lasts forever.

Chinese and India are moving away from a gold culture.  We've seen other precious metals start to move towards their industrial metal pricing (example platinum).  Gold has millennia of holding its value so one can reasonably reject this as unlikely to happen to gold. 

Could gold have a fantastic run?  Sure.  Could gold start generating a real return of say -3% for the next century, sure.  If you want to gamble, then gamble.  But if you want to invest in gold look at gold's fundamentals and at this price the fundamentals vs. the speculative numbers are terrible. 

Something like a 5% gold position does a nice job of being a diversifying asset.  I don't do gold, but I would do a broader commodities fund which are heavily gold.

I'm in commercial real estate and I have hand in multiple properties out here in Texas and Colorado that are giving me and our group of investors 12-15% returns by purchasing land, building and leasing shopping centers or stand alones on it, then in some instances selling the shopping centers or NNN properties at a return of 6-7%.  
  
Currently, with interest rates at 7%+ many franchisees of JIB, McDonalds, Taco Bell, Wendys, etc. are in an unfavorable position when it comes to building new locations or paying off existing debts as each of these businesses requires 2+m to build out. In low interest circumstances you would be buying these properties at a return of 5-6% return with leases extending 15-20 years. Currently its 7-8% return with 10-20 year leases and if you buy them from franchisees who have 20+ locations in bulk it can lead to returns around 9-10% per location for us and a relief for them on their loan balance. If you know what you're doing you'll look at the area for the factors you believe produce long term success, you make sure there is a fair rent to sales ratios, strong store sales, check the franchisees financial health, rent replacement risk, etc. More work than owning stocks but safer and easier to predict returns if you know the business.

caedin8,1713111374,kzjt4ej,1c3sw19,7,"The problem with conditional trading is that there is always a pattern that fucks you, and it fucks you hard

The solution to risk management is not conditional trades like a stop loss but a hedged counter position.

Buy out of the money puts that a very cheap that covers your position.

As an example you have $100 position you spend $2 for puts that get in the money when your primary position goes below $80.

Let’s compare two scenarios, one the position goes to $60 and another it goes to $60 and then back up to $100.

With a stop loss protection at $80 in the first scenario you’d sell at $80 and have saved $20. In the second scenario you’d sell at $80 and then if you bought back in at $100, so even though the stock is the same price as when you started you lost $20.

With a covered put in the first scenario you pay $2 for the put, and it becomes worth $40 when your main position goes to $60, so you end up at $98 or a $2 loss on a $40 drop, and you don’t have to sell your position which is good for taxes.

If it goes down to $60 and back to $100, you never sold so your main position is worth $100, and the put is worth nothing and you paid $2 for it so a $2 loss.

If the stock goes down to $80, your put would be worthless and you’d have the maximum loss for the position. You can tailor your maximum loss to your preferences by choosing the right put, just know that the higher your maximum loss you can tolerate the cheaper the put will be which will reduce the friction of that $2 fee over time.

I'm 65 and still working; this is my modest portfolio. Should I shift my allocations?

I'm in good health and plan to keep working for at least the next 2-3 years, primarily to build my retirement accounts but also because I'd just bore myself to an early death otherwise. I may scale back to part-time once I hit SS full retirement. I'm in HCOL area; there'll just be SS (current FRA projection is $38K annually) and my savings.

I'm single and was raising a family, modest income until very recently and I'm now playing catch-up to max out. Literally living paycheck to paycheck to do this. My current contributions plus employer match and share plan are all going to Vanguard 2025 TDF, roughly $45K annually between them.

My accounts are split between Empower, Fidelity and Schwab due to employer changes and rollovers and almost everything is tax-deferred. I want to consolidate and simplify but I've had analysis paralysis; the wild ride of 2024 hasn't helped.

Any recommendations regarding my allocations? I also have $30K emergency in HYSA that's not listed here.

Thanks!

I hold 10-15 stocks at once and they tend to average like half small cap value/growth and the rest mid cap/large cap. Meanwhile the S&P500 has 25.9% return so on a risk-adjusted basis, I beat the S&P 500 by 2% alpha. I will also say this is my goal and looking at regular correlation and not just beta (correlation is also notable here), it is around 0.53 which I believe is very good as not just do I operate to hedge my downside, subsequently capping my upside, but I try to be uncorrelated.

Regarding your argument, you’re both right, but honestly, based on those two trades of mega-cap stocks, he is kind of right. Those outlier returns when investing in the most invested in, not just traded, companies in the world don’t happen often. It’s why large cap funds have outperformed the most and in one study i read from 1980-2021, had no correlation between past performance and future performance for a manager.

Battlers_,1716029393,l4l0swz,1cuk88d,1,"I had similar argument and I was holding your exact position over the matter.

ETFs are just good are reducing risks while profiting an ever growing economy, which will push the global stockmarket up. So diversifying broadly through World ETF and SPY 500 will guarantee to catch the increase while diluting the benefits of stronger components with safer components. In brief, in a well diversified ETF, all you achieve is to reduce your potential gains while also reducing your risk of loss.

Meanwhile, investing on individual stocks imply of course a higher volatility but also a better potential for changes, if through rigorous studies of quantitative data (financial analysis, market future perspective...) and qualitative data (ie. strategic guidance, future area of development...) you identify potential for growth, you are likely to gave a better ROI.

Now, the main reason why I don't value ETFs over individual stocks is because, at the end an ETF is always ""multiple individual stocks"" however I don't have the time to research them all, some ETF are fully transparent on their fund repartition and it may not match my preferred spread. There is always some shady sh!t companies in it, that has no room for growth but won't plunge (or just steadily) that only purpose is to ""stabilize"" the overall index. And finally, by buying an ETF you delegate your share voting right to the trading company (such as vanguard or such) which may parasyte the strategic decisions.

By focusing on individual stocks you can better research and monitor them, which further reinforce your comprehension of the stock while finding more ""rationality"" in the so-called irrational market, because at the end, the volume traded are not so much mirrored on financial performance than they are just the mirror of human psychological behavior and beliefs.

Lastly, next time someone tells you your 100% ROI is pure luck, just remember ""it happens once call it luck, if it happens twice, call it talent"", 18 months is a Ling enough time to not be sonely the result of luck. Flipping a coin can only get you so far before your come back to the 1:1 ratio, so after X amount of transactions you can call it ""expertise"". Thinking otherwise would just be denying the fact that we can learn from trading activities (since it's apparently only a matter of luck), and that's just the easy way for justifying mediocrity. His ROI was mediocre compared to yours, and that's the root of his choice for ""easiness"" over real dedication to learn and risk-taking behavior.

Having started in February, I'm currently at 50% ROI, aiming at 100% over the year, going slowly but surely. I didn't find any ETF with a yearly growth superior to 34%.",ValueInvesting

In all likelihood the bonds were selected because if their maturity date and yield such that they worked well for the origional account owner. If you picked up a 4 year government bond that yields 4%, and don't need the money for 4 years, it really doesn't matter what interest rates or the bond price do in the meantime. 

There are many cases where assets are expected to decline in value in the short term, and it is in the best interest of clients to hold them.

There are also many cases where the best thing to do is let a declining position play out. 

Instead of asking people to explain how it doesn't breach fiduciary duty, why don't you start with why you think it is in violation of their fiduciary duty? 

One other thing I will point out is you are projecting losses backwards based on short term movements.

Awesome. He's basically set. If you Google the ""Trinity Study"" or the ""4% rule"", history suggests that he could set a very basic, conservative portfolio and draw 3-4% out of that nut annually without drawing it down to zero in 30+ years. At 3%, that's $285k (without even talking about Social Security), he should be able to live an incredibly comfortable life in retirement and (hopefully for you) leave a comfortable nest egg for his children as well.

There really isn't a ""good"" strategy to do this consistently, you'd have to do something extremely risk. And, at that point, why would he go back inside the casino? He's already won. Also, what do you mean ""help"" him double it? Does he want to do this? It's his money.

As a benchmark, the S&P500 returns ~10% a year (with heavy short-term volatility). Over 5 years, compounding, that's about a 60% gain.

So you could contribute to the Roth now, and if you end up needing this money later still withdraw it. 

You'll still have to decide how to invest the money within the Roth - for near term goals you generally choose less volatile investments, so plan accordingly.

One nice thing about investing in an index fund is that you don’t have to know what will be valuable in 20+ years. The index adjusts over time. That doesn’t mean every company is a winner, but the index at least stays current.

but_why_doh,1715993888,l4jdd4n,1cuk88d,5,"I might be in the minority here, but I really don't think it's that hard to beat the index. The reason people don't beat the index is because they invest on emotions, not facts. We often consider Warren Buffett to be some almighty god, but, I mean, a lot of his picks were just pretty solid, everyday companies at good prices. That's not terribly hard for most people to have. The biggest reason people lose money in the markets is either because they sell their winners. As long as you've done your DD, I see no reason why you can't beat the market. Now, 20%+ is absurd, but, like, 12% vs the market 10% is pretty achievable. That being said, most people still shouldn't, because A) most people are overly emotional, and buy/sell on a whim. B) most people don't put enough time or research into the companies and stocks they invest in, such as reading the 10k, or listening to the investor calls. C) most people don't have a high principle/capital, so the time/opportunity cost of taking a ton of time to learn investing and companies isn't worth it. After all, if you make 15% a year, but only have a $10000 account, you'd only make $1500 in a year, which is good, but you could've spent that time working an extra job or doing some side hustle, and easily made more than that, which you could've put into your account at market rates.",ValueInvesting

captionbubbly,1716031317,l4l41uv,1cuk88d,1,"I also bought google becuase I felt it was undervalued but I bought it at 120 and sold at 170 and also had a call for 160 since it was a decently high conviction play. Personally my strategy is basically to buy a lot of decent companies that would be in a ETF and just not buy the shit companies that usually hold those ETFs down, it’s not too hard and also finding single stocks that could have a bit of value in them and are oversold like Tesla was at 140 earlier this month, although imo I hold stock too short term and will probably get flagged for day trading but there’s just so much opportunity out there. Return is about 300% this year but that’s mostly because 2/5 of my portfolio was in crypto, and also recently sold most at near top then bought back the dip (although lost alot of money in the process trying to learn futures) I agree with you that if you’re dedicated there is an abundance of opportunity to invest in and also continuously looking for great companies will inevitably lead you to being able to occasionally spot them with some consistency. Also I like to buy shorter term leveraged ETFs after big dips or inverse them when I feel sectors are getting way to overvalued, since the market moves in cycles it’s impossible to find the absolute top but local tops and bottoms happen in all time frames and you can always make leveraged money from those moves. Hasn’t failed me yet but I’ve also made alot of really bad investments while learning how to invest most notable for me is MPW and palantir :/, however I don’t think I’ll make those types of mistakes in the future because I refuse to hold stocks that aren’t performing how I think they should nowadays and it has really saved me from holding stocks to the grave (although tbh I regret selling mpw and will probably buy more soon).  My current split is 40% crypto 20% dividend investing 10% options and 10% leveraged ETFs and 20% individual stocks although that doesn’t really account to all the spare cash I usually end up putting in a high yield savings account after taking profits everytime the market moves up so I can start buying back when it dips.

I don't care that a company I like has a market cap of $1 billion or $500 million. I care about how much money the company can potentially make going forward. If I don't feel that the company has a future, I shouldn't be invested in it regardless of what the market thinks.",stocks

This is usually the best way to get started with investing. A common US employer 401k may be something like: you put in 6% of your salary and they will match 4% for a total of 10% of your salary contributed to a 401k.

You then go into your 401k and direct where you want those funds to be invested.

Its an easy way to get ""free money"" (the employer match) as well as experience the market for years while contributing each paycheck.

After that look into a Roth IRA before you open a brokerage. With this you will contribute money you have already paid tax on, but when you withdraw from this account in retirement it will be tax-free.

401k, Roth IRA, HSA are all incredible tax deferred retirement investment vehicles in the US.

If they do for some period, it's likely because they took on risks that they themselves don't understand. I do mostly index investing with small/value tilt. 

But I reserve a portion of my portfolio for holdings that I really like, usually opportunities when securities seem to be mispriced, such as Meta or Alphabet, in 2022. Other times, I do a conservative DCF with stocks like DKS under 110 or ASO under 45 COST under 500 TXRH under 100 (all a while back), even spinoff divisions like SLVM or VLTO and it went well. I've let go of most of those prematurely, in my opinion, and I would've done better holding for more than 2 years (that it not to say go out and buy any of those of course), so even when I'm seemingly right, I'm wrong. It's no joke that the simplicity of holding a fixed allocation of broad markets is hard to beat for long periods. It's hard to know when to get in or let go of a company, but I enjoy owning certain businesses and going through the motions. 

My main point is that I hedge my own risk/dumbassery by having the majority of my portfolio and retirement accounts in no brainer Boglehead style global equity holdings but have room for 5-20% to be individual holdings if I really see the opportunity. It has to be a strong conviction for me not to just have it indexed. That higher bar for entry has probably helped me avoid mistakes. Right now, I only have 5 major individual holdings making up right under 5% of my total portfolio, I see some things, but not much exciting me enough to bite hard.",ValueInvesting

We created an LLC and were making tons of money with no debt and about 1000 invested initially. We flew to Hong Kong when I was 22 (this was not that long ago btw) right after we graduated from college as CS majors to sell the assets (the substantive part of the business) to a company there and we kept the cash that come in so far plus the proceeds. At this meeting, we learned very candidly that the owner could not meet with us (Americans) directly as the CCP does not allow that. We were required, in their offices, to communicate through an intermediary to finalize the deal. They sent in an American lawyer to ink everything. We were awarded some stock as additional performance bonus. However, we are never allowed to sell that stock and bring the cash back stateside. Due to a special CCP rule, the performance bonus part of our sale cannot be extracted unless we get approval first.

I manage money for a living and personally own a RILA. It's simple and doesn't require work. I get more return than what the market will do and have added downside protection at the same time. I could have done it myself, but the insurer made it conveniently priced. The rest of my money is individual stocks and a laddered fixed income allocation",investing

Positives I see is that apple is very well positioned to benefit from AI and this hasn't been 'priced in' yet since apple is a bit slow to innovate and AI is still early. 

AI requires tons of capital, the best talent, huge amounts of cutting edge hardware, enormous amounts of data and preferably an existing audience. Very few companies have all this.

I honestly don't know about NVDA, but I can see the case for its valuation much more clearly than I can for TSLA ( and NVDA being currently cheaper on forward estimates than TSLA helps....). The problem for NVDA is basically, how long do they keep growing at this rate? And on top of that, is this demand cyclical and will they see sales decline? 

Honestly, he's not the only one I heard with similar figures for Tesla. And in all fairness, maybe Tesla pulls it off. Personally I don't trust Elon enough to buy the story, but if you are a person who does buy it, the numbers can work. 

And maybe that's the problem with being too much of a value guy. I love Damodaran and all his work, but if you go too hard on numbers alone you can miss a lot. In the end, I think there is more to success than numbers. Personally, I don't trust Tesla management to deliver on their promises. Therefore, I can not presume to accurately put numbers into a spreadsheet. 

I still see lots of Apple defenders too. The hosts of Investtalk are buying as we speak based on their valuation of it. I don't see that either, but I haven't understood how apple keeps selling so many phones since about 2016. They've proven me wrong so far.... however, one thing I've tried to point out to people here is that apple hasn't really had to weather an economic slowdown since the iPhone came out. 2020 being the lone ""recession"" and there was nothing normal about that environment. We're sort of in uncharted waters for the company right now. I'd rather own apple than probably any other device maker, but I'm not sure I want any right now. 

So again I say, the magnificent 7 is really like the magnificent 3.5 for me. Only GOOG and META don't seem very expensive, though I don't think MSFT is absurd, just expensive. 

On a related note, I can't believe some.of the lesser EV plays are still holding on? Rivian is still an $8 billion company? I'm not a Tesla fan, but if Tesla is having a hard time, I can't imagine how rivian survives....",stocks

fundamentalsoffinanc,1713137206,kzls0tz,1c3q54x,3,"Hi, I'm a CFA charterholder and investment professional that works with high net worth and institutional clients (like as in billions of dollars invested with my company). Fundamentals of Finance is my YouTube channel I started with a friend to help people learn how to invest. This is a great question you've asked here.

So, obviously with any large group of people they're not all exactly the same. But, the vast majority of HNW (high net worth) people have advisors and the vast majority of their advisors would tell them to do nothing. 

Smart investors invest based on their objectives, and do not let the market dictate what they will do. They don't follow others into hot trends and they don't panic sell. Before there's a downturn they should be positioned in such a way that they will not lose more than they can stomach if a downturn comes. Then when one does, they can afford to wait it out (and will have the peace of mind to do so). You don't have to be HNW to do this. It has nothing to do with how much money you have and everything to do with your mindset and how well you've set up your account before the downturn comes.

I can help you with the thought process on how to put this in place if you're curious to learn more.",investing

datafisherman,1715975238,l4i36w0,1ctwunm,1,"Exactly right. On reflection, I think the simple way to put it, very roughly speaking, is that you could put perhaps half as much capital into such an opportunity but demand roughly double the return. In my case, I might take my upper bound (for detailed math) and make it my lower bound (for investment consideration). Today, my lower bound for investment consideration is a 5-year doubling, and my upper bound (beyond which I require only back-of-napkin math) is a 2-year doubling. In practice, I don't want anything less than 20-25%. But I don't explicitly discount. If I could halve the exposure, relative to a comparable US or Canadian investment, I think this is compatible with the level of concentration I want. In this scenario, I would require the 2-year doubling for China (minimum for investment consideration). And probably no more than my 3rd or 4th largest position.

If you were to go on a date or even go out with some friends and you and this nice girl wanted to go to a coffee shop, where would you go? Not Starbucks. You’re gonna pick a little boutique shop. Why? Because going to Starbucks is like going to McDonald’s. You don’t do it for a good product or a good experience, you do it because you can literally walk in, grab your coffee off the counter that you ordered online, and walk out.

Now, the problem for sbux is eventually people won’t or can’t pay $10 a drink for that experience. Just like people are stopping paying $15 for a Big Mac. At these price points, you can go and buy actual quality products, from places where your server/barista won’t have a room temperature IQ.

But the most likely one comes from when the reinvesting occurs. Companies from the index pay dividends at different times, and the provider won't re-invest every few (thousand) dollars. So a bit of cash drag is expected.

Even if you do reinvest every dollar as it comes in (doubtful, as there are some associated costs), it may not be the best outcome. The index may have been a bit lower a few times at the exact time the distributing version released it's dividends.

How big of a difference will this $6k make in the purchase of your home? What do you need for a down payment and how much do you need left over?

If it doesn’t make a material difference, then IRA is probably the way to go since you can expect ~8-10% average compounding tax free returns from now until retirement. Fiscally this is likely more efficient than putting it towards a house.

If her money is just sitting in a LISA I would probably go with HISAs, mutual funds, and other low-risk options. Short/long term liquidity may also be a concern. If her holdings are in excess of FDIC coverage she may be interested in a broker with a bank sweep program.

If she has a 401k with maximum contributions then go over her retirement goals and see if she's on track to meet them and go over any potential problems she may face. Is she counting on social security payments when she retires? Has she factored in inflation in her contributions, and what if it's higher than average? If the market goes on a ten year drop near her retirement, does she have a plan B? Too many people plan for the best in their retirement accoubts, and it never hurts long term to pad your 401k with a self-directed Roth IRA.

ValuableChris,1716005765,l4k1rt0,1cqr9ay,1,"Thanks for your questions. Great questions many of which I asked myself when writing and didn’t probably add as well as I should because the answers weren’t entirely clear, although I can give you what information I got.

One great source of information is an interview Simon Arora did about the history of B&M, which a lot of my subsequent answers will come from.

[https://offtolunch.substack.com/p/simon-arora-and-b-and-m-part-one](https://offtolunch.substack.com/p/simon-arora-and-b-and-m-part-one)

[https://offtolunch.substack.com/p/simon-arora-and-b-and-m-part-two](https://offtolunch.substack.com/p/simon-arora-and-b-and-m-part-two)

 For your first point I couldn’t really find much information on what Simon intends to do after B&M in the above interview he talks about wanting to get involved in the running of other businesses, although not in a full time role but as a non-executive chairman or something. He said he thought the time he left B&M was an opportune time with the business doing very well.

With the stock sales as I said in the article him and his brothers still own a lot of the company and Bobby still work there. But the health of the company is still something to watch during the transition. In the above interview Simon discusses how he and his brothers didn’t want it to be a multigenerational family affair with nieces and nephews fighting over positions at the company.

In the past they have sold stakes in their business and the business has continued its growth for example in 1012 prior to their IPO they sold a major stake to a private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.

 

For your second questions on the Chinese and East Asian supply chain you are correct this is a potential issue. Although one thing that makes me less concerned about it is they didn’t seem as far as I can see to have many issues over Covid with it. China was going into lock downs and they were having disruptions to supply chains and they did better than average. Since Covid they have diversified to other East Asian suppliers and so if there were major trade barriers due to political issues they could rely more on them. Although this would still likely create disruptions I think and is a risk. However if countries are going to get into trade wars I think it’s going to be more focused on higher tech goods like EV’s and semiconductors instead of low cost, low tech consumer goods.

In addition I think they now also have greater economies of scale, so if there was a disruption to supply change they are buying a large enough amount of goods they could get these goods at discounts.",ValueInvesting
ValuableChris,1716005784,l4k1t0i,1cqr9ay,1,"My answer to your third question is mostly based on what I’ve heard from others opinions as one day it just disappeared from their annual report. They acquired 80% in in 2014 German discounter Jawoll  and after making losses sold it in 2020. From what I’ve read the German retail market is a lot more competitive and consumers are more used to buying private label brands due to the likes of Aldi and Lidl, who already have significant economies of scale in Germany. That’s about all I got for that one. I don’t think a company making an loss like this is necessarily a bad thing as long as they also get some wins and they don’t bet the whole business on things like this, as although Germany didn’t work out its more than been compensated for in France.

 

On your fourth point about partnership, I don’t think it’s a formal partnership, but is instead more an idea Simon sort of goes into in the aforementioned interview. He pretty much says their product offering in terms of value is better than UK incumbents such as Tesco, but they don’t offer the same variety. So consumers will buy what they can from B&M at better value then get the rest at the UK retailer with a wider selection, but higher prices. For the likes of Aldi and Lidl he says they are famous for their private label goods and although he doesn’t say it in the interview these are probably greater value than B&M. So relative to them B&M are able to provide branded goods that consumers are willing to pay more for because they’re branded rather than private label.

So maybe another name for it is differentiation where you have a competitor which may be able to offer a better range (Tesco and Morrison’s) or better value (Aldi and Lidl) you offer the consumer something else such as better value on some essential goods or branded products. It is in a way stealing share by trying to find consumers at your competitor you can take by offering something slightly different and Simon in the interview I got it from was just trying to put it in friendlier language.

 

Finally n your last question. As I said in the article they have a higher net margin which would mean they are able to keep operating overheads lower relative to PoundLand. In addition if you look at the 99p take over this probably created more problems for PoundLand than it solved and I am always very suspicious when a company says they will solve an issue through M&A.

One thing I have heard from here say about B&M is their strict control over costs. In addition Simon in his interview talks about their “magic source” being their supply chain. Their prior business was Oriental Servicing limited which imported goods from Asia and sold them to UK retailers and then they sold that and put some of the money into their takeover of B&M relying on some of those relationships to source goods from manufacturers directly to their stores. Something else Simon discusses in their interview is “B&M speed”, where customers like to be served fast at the checkout and its better to make a decision that you think is 80%-90% right than 100% right at the expense of lots of time. Finally Simon also brought up the GFC in 2008 being good for discount retailers, as many prominent UK retailers went bankrupt and landlords or previously wouldn’t have rented prime space to upstart discounters had no choice.",ValueInvesting

WinningTocket,1713654168,l0iq9kz,1c8y56a,3,"Well, that's part of why I asked, because I don't think you're correct. full Disclosure: I'm not Canadian but I do work with taxes and tax planning. 

What's happening in my mind is not that anyone is going to change their behavior, because this can't possibly be the first time some tax law has been made that changes how things are run in the history of Canada, but instead that this is going to change how that money moves, how it is accounted for, and what it is counted as. 

As I am not Canadian I can't speak to the laws regarding whether there are choices and elections made every year or few years for tax treatment of assets but I would find it hard to believe that, esp. since these things are usually known long prior to getting to the public by the private sector who literally plans for them as accountants and other financial professionals, no one already doesn't have an answer to this.

Makes a little more sense now but I’m gonna be honest with you there’s no way you can pull this off. You can’t just start a sports betting site with just player connections. This would take years of planning and development as well as a ton of money and setbacks. 

Here’s a short list of things you will need to achieve in order to successfully develop a sports betting site:

1. Get through legal and regulatory concerns 
2. Develop payment processing systems
3. Develop a complex system that can handle real time betting
4. Detect and prevent suspicious activity
5. User acquisition and retention
6. Customer support 
7. Data security 
8. Marketing/Partnerships

DReddit111,1713269608,kzthmxi,1c53iff,2,"I just look at the math and history. In the long run the US stock market is the best thing going over the last hundred years. There are  crazy short term fluctuations, but if you invest regularly (same amount each month, aka dollar cost averaging) and don’t ever sell, the dips are actually really good for you because you buy the shares cheaper and it pushes your average cost down. Low cost index diversified index funds are the super simple and easy. You open a brokerage account, pick an index fund like the S and P 500, set up the automatic monthly contributions to what you can afford without too much pain and then forget about it. After 30 years of dollar cost averaging and average growth in the market it’s the most likely way to retire comfortably. On the other hand if you do the same thing with a “safe” savings account it won’t earn enough interest to do that. Now is an exception, but over the last 30 years mostly you couldn’t earn enough in a savings account to even keep up with inflation. In effect the safe investments are more or less guaranteed to lose in the long run. The “riskier” stock market investments are more likely to succeed in the long run.

One thing you do have to be careful about. Stocks do fluctuate and if you find yourself needing to sell at a bad time in the market you will lose money. You have to keep enough of an emergency fund in accounts that won’t lose money short term no matter what, like FDIC insured high yield savings accounts, in the event of a job loss or big unexpected expense. If you have enough “safe” money to get you through 6 months or a year then you probably won’t have to sell your stocks during any stock downturn. You don’t actually ever take any losses unless you sell low.

Hardest part is to stick with the long term plan and ignore the news and the day to day fluctuations. If you make buy and sell choices based on short term changes in the market you’ll almost certainly lose. US stock market is a casino where people can actually win, but only long term. Steady, patient, never chase the hot new thing and expect to get rich slowly, not right away.",investing

AP9384629344432,1713663885,l0jds35,1c8lv0c,13,"Some recent TSLA news (I don't own any Tesla stock or have a position, I just find this too entertaining to not comment on)

- [$2K price cuts on Model Y, S, X in the US](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1781552372893757831). Unclear if will extend globally. If you remember they did a few $1K price hikes a few weeks back, but it looks more likely it was to incentivize last minute buys before quarter end so they could juice the earnings report.
- Major cuts in shifts/staff in the China Gigafactory ([link](https://twitter.com/tphuang/status/1781375886777831715)).
- Now he a bit of a polemic on Twitter, but @BradMunchen's Substack posts are actually pretty detailed / well thought out. [Here is a very recent post](https://bradmunchen.substack.com/p/could-tesla-go-bankrupt-the-odds?r=24r7n0&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true). What stood out to me was [this table on working capital needs](https://i.imgur.com/6TClPbG.jpeg), cash, and debt ratings. Although on paper Tesla has a ton of cash on hand, its long term debt is just one notch above a junk debt rating. Compare this to Toyota, which has a very large debt load, but a better credit rating. The reason is high working capital needs. Auto companies can burn through their cash very very quickly, [as Nissan demonstrated](https://i.imgur.com/ti9qbGe.jpeg). Telsa apparently has -$7B in net working capital (see post for why table differs). This means it may quickly need to draw down from its cash pile due to issues with short-term liabilities.
- Apparently >$3K Cybertrucks just got recalled, and not for a simple software update, but an actual mechanical issue with the brakes
- Shareholders voting on whether the CEO gets $56B package, which will force major dilution of equity. [This is what that CEO spends time on during working hours, by the way](https://i.imgur.com/YvsNg0r.png).

If the macro environment has a median P/E of 40, it is scored well.

During back testing, portfolios were created every month and followed the same process - buy and hold for 1 year, then liquidate and do it all over again.  There was no bias in performance towards any start point for any portfolio.  I take that to mean that it does pretty well in most macro environments.

Do you understand the inherent risk in their balance sheet, especially their assets? Liabilities are usually straight forward (deposits), but do you understand the implications of their equity ratio?

Two examples:
In 2008, banks loaded on masses of foul mortgage backed securities with great interest rate, except the underlying mortgages sucked. When those defaulted, banks went bust (or got bailed out).

In 2020's a lit of banks uploaded on long term t-bonds with low interest rates. When interests rose, the bond prices fell. Because the bonds were marked as ""hold to maturity"", so the asset value decline did not show up on their balance sheet. Some banks folded (100% equity loss), but the biggest banks (eg Citi) still have significant positions in those non-performing assets.

LufaMaster,1731462985,lwumeii,1gmwv8m,1,"MBLY: The bitter lesson question is a good one.  I'll read it as ""Isn't AI going to solve this problem... and in \~10 years it will be relatively easy for AI to solve?"".  My answer: maybe?  MBLY says going all-in on AI to drive a car is not a good idea, if for no other reason, after a car crash the passengers, the government, and the automaker all want to know WHY the car did what it did.  If you are fully reliant on AI, the answer is effectively unknown, as AI is a bunch of magical spaghetti.  That said, this guy Elon at Tesla does believe in AI and he has forgotten more about this subject then I will ever know.  MBLY says its harnessing AI in places it makes sense.  They have also been using big data machine learning since like 2005, before it was cool.  So this Gen AI boom didn't catch them off guard.  Last, AI isn't likely the first solution to solve this problem.  Waymo, Tesla, and MBLY are all super close to solving it (Waymo already there basically), so its more about who becomes the incumbent by 2028-2030...  and then how high are the switching costs of moving off a proven platform with MBLY to a new vender who is riskier (and may kill people if it doesn't work well).  I think if MBLY gets selected and it works, the market share will be very sticky.  Last last, this stock will likely have a massive move by 2027, long before AI completely solves a problem like autonomous driving.  So worry about that in 3 years.

AMD: yeah I think the MI325 is solid in inference workloads and to a lesser extent also good in some training workloads.  And the roadmap for the MI350 and MI400 keeps AMD \~3-6 months behind NVDA which is respectable.  More importantly, I think MSFT, META, ORCL, AMZN, GOOG, TSLA, etc all want a second source to keep NVDA honest.  To have a second source be a real threat to NVDA, you need to give them 10-20% of your business.  So you will see those big six customers give 10-20% of their business to AMD even if the ROI is slightly worse (key word = slightly).  If not, you give NVDA too much strength.  Remember, AMD is likely going to have $10b+ datacenter GPU revenue in 2025, up from effectively zero in 2023.  That compares to NVDA at $200b DC GPU revenue in 2025.  $10b for AMD is a mere 5% share.  

MRVL: Currently, yes, AVGO dominants the custom silicon market but only via one customer: Google's TPU.  Google just signed MRVL to build them a custom ARM CPU (most similar to a CPU - but its its own thing).  AMZN has MRVL building them a custom inference chip and a custom training chip.  MSFT has MRVL building them a custom datacenter chip as well.  I think META is also giving both AVGO and MRVL some business.  MRVL has publicly said they see this as a \~$40b TAM in a few years and they can have something like 35% share.  They basically said: ""our current total revenue is $5b.  We are entering a new market of custom silicon in 2024...  and by \~2028 we think this new custom silicon market can be $10b of revenue to us.  Meanwhile our existing core revenue of $5b will also basically double by \~2028.  So in 2024 we have $5b total revenue and by 2028 that might be like $20b revenue.""  I'm cool with companies that 3x their revenue in four years.

Head_Carpet7866,1731495354,lwwdbux,1gq9jln,2,"Hello, I am 18 years old and want to start trading/investing my 115k Trust fund.

I just recently turned 18 and got a large Trust fund from my Grandfather, that he gave to my Dad in 2014 when he died. My Dad has invested the money into low risk and/or dividend stocks such as Nestle, Zurich insurance Group and Mercedes. He also laid aside some „safety“ money for liquidity.  It has grown from 100k in 2014 to 115k now, with 85k in Stocks, 15k in the UBS strategy fund and 15k in Liquidity. The Currency is mostly swiss francs, but there is also a 5,7k part of the liquidity which is in Eur. I have no clue what exactly to do, but I want to break away from my bank because of the high costs. I am not sure if switching to another Bank is the right call, my dad said if I wanted to switch, he would recommend ING. I want to start trading with mid to long term gains, but I also want to have a little bit of money to „play around“ in short term trading, maybe Crypto? (My roommate made 2k yesterday trading solana and dogecoin?) I want to start because I am very interested in how politics/news interact with the markets. I was and am very interested in the Gamestop short squeeze four years ago. I am scared of „just trying“ because I think the european markets are going to slip into a recession and/or crash. I dont want to lose all my money. I have no debts, live in Switzerland, want to retire early with good Savings, about 10m would be great. „Early“ Retirement would be about 35-40 years old. I am studying at University right now and am in search for a side Job right now.

stickman07738,1731508778,lwx7o0d,1gqddej,3,"We are in the early innings of AI with hardware leading.

For me, the hardware will become commoditized but the question is when - I personally suspect in \~ 5 years.

In my opinion, the generational winners will be companies with the largest datasets will prevail - GOOG=BIDU > APPL> AMZN=BABA > MSFT=META but there will also be industry specific players (like healthcare, i.e., drug discovery , possibly UNH or research hospital like MSK or Duke Univ), defense maybe PLTR, travel = BKNG, retail (specifically grocery) - any large chains with loyalty programs (they know a lot about you and your preference) or TSLA has more driving data, particularly for autonomous driving AI.

I would also not rule out Bloomberg as they have immense financial data sets and how companies interrelate. I suspect they are already using it and being private do not publicize it.

MSFT except for OFFICE has been a follower or acquirer; they were way behind on AI and is the reason they partnered with OpenAI and did better PR.

I personally am sticking with Google and META as they already have large datasets on consumer personal preferences and searches.

I also suspect that APPL (I know they partner with OpenAI for the consumer front, but believe they have internal products) and AMZN have better AI tech as it is captive and will never be in the open market for competitive reasons.

There was a good new release of data is king and those that can exploit data will win. Isomorphic Labs partnering with LLY and NVS on drug discovery. If you can shorten drug discovery time and extend protection - it is a big win.

cjorgensen,1713137653,kzlt3cz,1c3q54x,13,"Sure. I got out of debt at 40. So not student loan or credit card debt. No car debt. Everything was pretty much at zero. I had $30k in a 401k, $20k in a defined pension plan, and another $30k in a Roth IRA. I made a lot of mistakes getting to this point. I was forced to get serious with the debt at around 35 when they garnished my wages for the student loans, so once those were gone, I had been miserable and got mad at the credit cards. I crawled out of the hole, but it took five years.

I got a new job. Saw a jump in my pay by $12k a year, my health insurance dropped by $200 a month, and I cut out the expense of a second car and a two hour commute (1 hour each way). I had the opposite of lifestyle creep. I moved in with my girlfriend, so had only half a mortgage to pay, stopped eating out everyday (with my previous commute and extended hours I got lunch out most days).

So I had maybe $80k in retirement accounts and a paid off car to my name at 40. I didn’t even have an emergency fund. I was out of debt though, and started investing. I got a $30k inheritance and put $12k in a HYSA and the other $18k into AAPL.

So maybe 41 for $100k. I was and felt *way* behind. So I started investing in mostly silly stocks. Weed stocks and pharmaceutical stocks and various tech stocks. I didn’t really know what I was doing though, so when some of these stocks started doing well I panic sold. So while I bought AMD at $5 I sold it at $12 for a short term capital gains. I spent a few years splashing around until I realized I was just getting lucky in a bull market.

So I sold everything except AAPL and bought *more* AAPL with my proceeds. I got excited when I hit $250K. I was around 45.

I live frugally. Small house, small mortgage at a small interest rate, no kids, no expensive hobbies, so I invest a large portion of my income. Ten years ago I was making $55k a year. Now I make $75 in a MCOL area. My 403b is generous and I kick in extra. I’ve maxed out my Roth every year since I got out of debt.

I hit $500k at 50, and $700k at 54. When that money doubles in the next 7-10 years I will pull the pin. I am not yet to a million, but I am way past the point that my growth is outpacing my contributions, so even if the market goes sideways for a decade I’ll hit a million by 64.

Trading is a losers game. Most who trade lose money, 95% of people who day trade (even professionals) lose money. The only way to win is *not to play at all*. You buy a low cost while market fund like VTI/VOO/S&P500 and hold for 10+ years. Buy more as often as you can *regardless of price* and after 10+ years you should have a nice profit. It really is that simple.

Think you know it all and still lose big due to a black swan event, or plain bad luck.

Elibroftw,1716509927,l5ehnt6,1cyy8pt,1,"Nvidia is valued on the basis that revenue can never go down. Such faulty logic had been applied to LULU, SBUX, and under armour. 


I'm not buying Nvidia because this a silicon company that got lucky that Meta spends so much on capex. Zuckerberg is literally crazy. If AI is truly that great then we shouldn't be focusing on the supplier but the user. Microsoft is a fair valuation since they sell the software to use AI and they are plenty diversified. Meta is the problem though. They make money with ads and I own a quest 3 and it's missing lots of productivity features that I want to develop. 


So the demand side isn't guaranteed to continue every year. Usually capex is something that depreciates over 5+ years and not something you have to replace every year. Nvidia depends way to much on meta. One of the risks a lender identifies when deciding to lend to a company is the customer concentration. If meta wasn't run by Zuckerberg would Nvidia even be worth so much (no).


Lastly, which is more relevant for silicone, is the competition. For this we'll use history. When Ryzen came out, it took Intel 2-3 years to match core count. Currently Intel is still too dog in laptops, however they lost in the gaming sector. However, Intel decided to start competing in GPUs and they're next generation should be announced shortly. Basically took them 3 yrs again. 


Additionally, companies like google and Amazon and known to make their own silicon for their data centres. 


When taking a look at apples M1 chip, it was launched in November 2020. Snapdragon elite X took 4 years from then to launch and basically catch up and even then Intel is trying to claim its own chips are just as good.


So why did I talk so much? Nvidia is a short term play. It's going to take 4 years before news comes out that tanks the share price, and 6 years before financials are impacted. This is all good if you are planning on holding Nvidia for 2-3 years but as I said, demand side is too risky for my appetite. We don't know how the market will react when big tech decides the gpu investment is too costly (or they make their own chips).


So yes Nvidia's tech is supreme but for how long and what'll be the turnover in the demand?",ValueInvesting

LostInLife8989,1713795206,l0qsrde,1ca9qkq,-8,"Public companies are so fucking wacky. If you were talking about paying Musk cash or a salary of $56 billion, I’d be with you. But they agreed to give him 1.68 million public shares in the company 5 years ago when it was worth $50 billion total. For whatever reason, people bought Tesla shares making it go up to over $1 trillion and Musk’s target was only $650 billion.

Even if you hate Musk. How is it far that they agreed to give him a certain number of shares if he hit what was considered at the time to be nearly impossible? Keep in mind his original agreement said he got literally nothing if he failed to get the company to at least $650 billion within the 5 year period.

Even if he only took it to $650 billion, that would mean he created $600 billion in value. Asking for $56 billion is really just asking for around 15% of the wealth he created, isn’t it? Is that crazy? I just commented on another post where a guy is taking 30% from the YouTuber he works for in a shared revenue deal. So getting 15% of the whatever you generate seems fair?

Even disliking Musk. I am not sure how it’s fair not to give him his shares? Of all the messed up things about him, it doesn’t seem like asking to be given what people said they would give you after you accomplished something they thought impossible (and keep in mind he made them $600 billion, they’re still keeping $544 billion in shares they wouldn’t have had without him, isn’t that a fair trade? $56 billion for $544 billion?)",stocks

SirGlass,1731521365,lwybwb5,1gqgzw9,3,"Don't forget the value of time

I mean take this simple thought experiment, lets say you have 100k to invest. Lets also assume you are a great value investor (this is a big assumption ) and lets say by careful stock picking and monitoring you can ""beat the market"" by 300 basis points

Meaning if the market goes up 10% you go up 13% , if the market goes down 5% you only go down 2%. Also note this would put you like the top .1% of investors 

Now doing this takes work, it takes time, you have to pour over companies filings, understand some macro trends of the industry , and keep up with changes to the industry , economy and technology what could affect these companies

Lets just say it takes you 15 hours a week, to learn, study , doing WACC and DCF calculations. On a 100k investment you will achieve 3k excess returns in a year, and put in 780 hours of work.

This means you are earning about $3.85 per hour of work.  You would be better off just investing in an index fund and spend that 15 hours a week working an minimum wage job and investing your earnings into index funds from this part time minimum wage job

Now if you had 1 million to invest this might change the equation because now you are getting 30k excess returns , what gives you an hourly earnings of about $38 an hour

However all this assumes you are a great value investor and can actually beat the market buy 300 points what is very unlikely .",investing

Personally I do a little of both. I have the majority of my money in a 401k that has just a couple of ETFs and I only check it a couple times a year. Next is a Roth IRA that is similar, and I contribute weekly. The majority is in a S&P 500 ETF, but I'm able to add some alternative funds, as well as a few individual stocks. Then i have a personal brokerage account where I trade individual stocks. This account only makes up about 5% of my total savings, and as it grows to a certain threshold I transfer most of those profits over to my Roth IRA.

The only reason I can think of for recommending peopel buy bonds or maintain a 60/40 or whatever portfolio balance during accumulation is that people think we're stupid and can't manage the transition.

greytoc,1713192732,kzopnrz,1c4mduu,9,"Lack of fixed income products and mutual funds is just one thing. But realistically, there are lots of ETFs these days which can be used as a substitute. 

For me - it's services like, access to futures, portfolio margin, 24x7 live support, dedicated customer rep, local presence for certain transactions, API, etc. 

There are also some fees like wire fees that matter to me. I do make use of wires often and Fidelity doesn't have a fee for inbound/outbound wires. 

Robinhood also doesn't support common option strategies like box spreads - which I use regularly. Although to be honest, Fidelity's margin requirements on long box is kinda useless. 

Robinhood is kind of a weird broker - imo. They really went after very inexperienced active traders who don't really know much about trading and investing with the promise of no commissions and a dumb-down application process. That really swelled their account numbers but average account size was very small. The reality is that many brokers already offered no commission trading to their active traders so the more experienced traders with larger account sizes don't usually consider Robinhood as a viable broker. 

So - I'm guessing that these promos that Robinhood is doing is a way to try to entice larger accounts. It actually makes sense why Robinhood is doing these promos. 

For me - a buy and hold IRA portfolio and the credit card promos can make sense. And that's what I'm looking at Robinhood. But I'm not really sure how Robinhood would make money off accounts like mine so the account grab just doesn't make sense to me. 

Ultimately - I do think that the Robinhood promos are good incentives. And it can be a great way for many people to get an extra few hundred bps even if it's not permanent. I do think that it's a personal choice though - for me - the extra bps may not be worth it. 

I like the comfort of knowing that I can have really good support and customer service from a broker. As an example - today is the tax deadline. Due to my mismanagement and misunderstanding from my tax accountant, I ended owing a large payment. This meant that I had to move funds from some Fidelity and Schwab accounts into a bank account. With both firms - I was able to get transferred to their wire desk and reach an actual wire clerk who stayed on the phone with me while they did the actual wire transfer.

I'm not sure I would get the same type of support from Robinhood. I have been trading and investing for decades so I've seen and have had accounts at dozens of brokers. And I've worked at a couple (institutional only) brokers. So I'm a little familiar with how brokers work. I do think that Robinhood has a good opportunity to be a great retail broker if they can just get hit the right sweet spot. 

So - if you are looking to try out Robinhood - it could certainly work well for you. Everyone has their own requirements, just because it may not be right for me - doesn't mean that it won't work for you.",investing
harrison_wintergreen,1713192891,kzoq49v,1c4nwry,25,"I follow your line of reasoning, but it's a common misconception about small cap investing. 

small cap investing isn't successful because you find the next Microsoft when it's still a teeny-tiny company and before the stock goes up 10x. 

small cap investing, particularly small cap value, is successful for an entirely different reason: the companies are more risky than larger companies (as a general rule) but the stocks are cheaper (by price to earnings, price to book, etc). as another general rule, most of your long-term ROI with stocks is based on valuation ... what you pay today for the stock, compared to what you get in the future in terms of dividends or cashflows. Small value companies are usually boring as dirt, they have nothing in their favor except good financial fundamentals bought cheap. 

If you buy the cheapest bracket of small cap stocks, and rotated out of them on a regular basis, it would still outperform large cap stocks over time even without any of the stocks moving up to mid cap or large cap status.

That being said, unless you’re within 5 years of retirement OR you invest in things you shouldn’t be investing in with a retirement account, your situation is probably the same as mine and you should take the free money. 

I’ll even be crossing my fingers that in 5 years Schwab/ webull/ etc may have some sort of IRA promotion for free money then also and I’ll do that one too.

but_why_doh,1716513429,l5epu48,1cyy8pt,2,"Nah, it doesn't matter how good their tech is. While yes, they are at least 5 years ahead(which in chipmaking is a REALLY long time) the market is currently pricing Nvidia as if they are the only player in town. AMD already has chips in deployment, and Intel is working heavily to get companies on board. Amazon and Microsoft are also already developing Ai chips. These chips don't need to disrupt Nvidia, they just need to take a couple percentage points of market share. That would either cause Nvidia to need to drop prices, or lose some market share. Again, this likely won't be a ton, but enough to cause the current market price to struggle. Also, large companies are not gonna stomach these high prices for forever. Meta has already dedicated 35B to Ai, Google at 100B, Amazon at 48B, Microsoft at 14B. These are not small amounts of money. That amount from Google is more than their 2023 net income. Once these companies realize that they're spending SO much money just to be 3rd or 4th, they will have to either double down, or cut back, and investors will really drive the narrative here. Investors can only stomach massive capex for so long, otherwise they'll begin to revolt. Sure, Ai will go on for a long time, but there won't be as many players. Also, the idea that Nvidia is selling ""intelligence"" is only partly true. A lot of data science and other ""intelligence"" based tasks do run on Nvidia GPUs, but these make up a small fraction of the total revenue, as data science and other tasks like this require significantly less compute than massive LLMs. It's also worth noting that most of the current spend is not on chips for compute or training, but for just running the models. OpenAi has said that it takes significantly more chips to run ChatGPT than it did to train the models. Overall, the current pricing of Nvidia is priced to everything going perfect for the company, which is typical of a market darling stock. The problem comes when 1-2 things go wrong, which are not priced in. 

Nvidia is a great company with amazing management, a solid product, and a great moat, but their current pricing is simply too high. They don't need to lose steam, but other players either have to pick up steam or lose it. If large companies grow weary of massive spending and cut back, that causes massive revenue drops. If AMD or Intel come out with an innovative chip solution that knocks it out of the park, causing Nvidia to drop their own prices to compete, that causes a massive revenue drop. Hell, if LLMs don't advance for a really long time(A lot of experts in Ai such as Andrew Ng have said it could take decades, if not centuries, to get to real Ai, and said that advancements will continue to be slow) that could cause a slowdown in spending, which would cause a revenue drop. There's just too many possible catalysts for a drop, and currently the company is being priced as if these risks just don't exist",ValueInvesting

Production is not far off pre war levels which means the cash flow is going to be insane.  
Quite speculative but I think that Zhevago might be unloading his shares which is what is causing this price spiral. The production report for q1 came out and the stock jumped about 15-20% and since then there hasn’t been any news other than article about iron exports being at highs but despite that the stock still drops and drops. If he is unloading then it could cause the government to give up on hammering the company.

creemeeseason,1713305189,kzwbzhe,1c5bv6m,2,"Had to throw a few more homebuilder items out there. I love this line from a VIC writeup about DHI:

""In today’s market, it seems that companies with above-average growth, high-ROEs, and good balance sheets come with the expected burden of very rich-P/Es. One industry presents the combination of 20-30% ROEs, net-cash balance sheets, double-digit EPS growth, little threat from technological disruption (or aggressive Chinese competition). And, the said industry is trading at 10x earnings."" 

Full article [here](https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/D.R._HORTON/0499558715).

I still love DHI, however, I've also been reviewing a smaller company, DFH (Dream finders homes).  From their founding, DFH has copied the asset light model of NVR. This has allowed them to grow  revenue at a 30% CAGR since 2018, and net income has grown at a 52% CAGR during that period. They do have debt, more on that in a second, but not a ton. DHI, as an example has a debt/equity ration of 0.23 and DFH boasts a 0.79 ratio. So they do have higher debt which they used to make acquisitions. The debt is my big worry with the company. Almost all their debt is in a revolving credit line and matures in 2026. If rates stay high until then, DFH could see a huge increase in their interest expenses. 

However, there are not many companies growing at 30% or more that trade at 12x earnings. DFH presents a possible high beta way to play homebuilders. It's also founder lead and has high insider ownership, traits that generally bode well for a company. 

On a side note, I came across a great [breakdown ](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/what-makes-housing-so-expensive?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Fhousing&utm_medium=reader2)of why houses are so expensive now. It even breaks down the costs of building a new house. Very informative.",stocks

TheMostEpicFace,1731438108,lwsj948,1gpqp30,6,"Your son has a solid financial foundation at 38 years old. Here’s a breakdown of his current situation:

1. **Retirement Savings**:
   * **401(k)**: $360,000
   * **Brokerage Account**: $550,000
   * Total in retirement and investment accounts: $910,000
2. **Emergency Fund**:
   * **Money Market (MM) Fund**: $72,000
3. **Home Equity**:
   * **House Value**: $250,000

# Total Net Worth Calculation

* Total investments + emergency fund + home equity = $910,000 + $72,000 + $250,000 = **$1,232,000**

# Considerations

* **Age and Savings Goals**: Many financial advisors suggest having 2-3 times your annual income saved by age 40. If your son is earning a typical salary for his age in the tech industry, he might be on track or even ahead of this guideline.
* **Investment Strategy**: He has a significant amount in a target date fund and a brokerage account, which indicates he is investing wisely. Diversifying his investments could be beneficial, but it seems he is doing well with what he has.
* **Perspective on Being ""Behind""**: It’s common for people to feel behind in their savings due to societal pressures or comparisons with peers. However, based on the figures provided, he is actually in a strong financial position.

# Conclusion

Your son is not behind in terms of financial health for his age. It might be helpful for him to reassess his goals and possibly consult with a financial advisor to create a plan that aligns with his aspirations and risk tolerance. Encouraging him to focus on his achievements rather than comparisons could also help shift his perspective.",investing

- Access to investments you won’t get as an individual. Hiring the right firm will give you access to hedge funds, private equity, private credit, and direct real estate pools that you won’t be able to access otherwise 
- Tax planning. Any advisor worth their salt should be able to tax loss harvest, optimize asset location to minimize taxes, and create a plan that will ensure you’re maximizing your wealth.
- Creating a portfolio that maximizes risk-adjusted return. As you’re in your working years it’s easy to just DCA into passive index funds.

  In the real world retirees don't have wage income because they are retired.  Bonds pay interest income that can pay your bills.

So in a recession you can sell bonds instead of your stocks (so you don't eat the seed corn in a down market).

Both CG accounts are setup with CG mutual funds (GWPAX and AAFTX), so I'm assuming those funds can't be transferred over to Fidelity, and instead I would need to sell them off and then re-invest that money? Even though that would be a taxable event, I assume it would be worth it long-term to not have to pay those fees anymore?

Hopefully that's not a totally dumb question. I'm not as clueless as I was when I started, but I'm still a newbie.....",investing

Particular-Natural12,1716491091,l5d4wjo,1cxxcdv,2,"Yeah, your whole edit is not what I was objecting against? Weird of you to bring it up. My point if you're speaking in generalities as if they are fact and they're provably not. One doesn't need $5M for my point to stand, either, it was, I thought, an obviously arbitrarily chosen number. 

Someone can spend maybe 100-200 hours per year over several years to discover, DD, and closely monitor a handful of high conviction ideas, and those ideas can, as a group, generate alpha (some winners, some losers obviously). Call it 150 hrs/yr on average over 20 years. 

Starting with a $100k portfolio (not a farfetched figure imo) and averaging just 2 points of alpha per year, that works out to 3k hours of research that generated about $100/hr in the form of alpha. Sure, lots of people make more than $100/hr, but those people are probably managing portfolios that are *substantially* larger than $100k, greatly boosting the effective hourly rate of return for them. The primary reason it's just $100/hr in this example is because I'm starting with a relatively small portfolio. 

This whole idea that you need to blow the doors off the indices or whatever to make active investing worth it is silly to me. Sure, in some cases, especially for people who have very small portfolios, that's true, but it's not some ironclad reality.

If he  sells chars he likely will deplete his account and could run out of many.  IF however he invests all of his money in funds to provide a 5% dividen you would get $50,000 a year of income to cover living expenses.  There are funds right now that yield a reasonably safe 10%.  That would get him $100K a year.  But even with the high yield he may still run short on money.  

Inflations averages 3.2% per year.(yes currently it is higher)  That means every year the money buys less than it did the year before.   So in his final years he may still have to sell shares to get buy.  And if he has to move into assisted living his expenses will be even higher.  The key to fight inflation is to insure that you spend no more than 50% of your yearly income and reinvest the reat in more dividend Hopefully that would keep him ahead of inflation.",investing

If he is still early or even mid-way through the mortgage paying process and a lot of that payment is interest, then he should pay off the mortgage, saving himself a ton of money in interest payments. If he is later into his mortgage than most of his payments are principle - much less of a rush to pay it off in this instance and he should consider investing this money and just making his mortgage payments. The statements should provide a breakdown of interest vs principle and the bank can also provide the amortization schedule so you can easily see how much interest is still left on the loan.

lifesabeeatch,1713112815,kzjx38l,1c3w6jc,8,"Rates on Treasury bonds have declined over the past 2 years. I'm still holding some that were getting close to 10% but have since declined to be comparable to Treasury bills.  T-bills are shorter duration (4-52 weeks) vs bonds and given the comparable yields (5.27% for i-bonds and 5.1-5.3% for T-bills), I'd suggest looking at these instead of the longer duration bonds (that also have an interest penalty if you sell before maturity).  They are also State tax free if that's a factor for you.

I prefer to buy my own T-bills vs using a fund like FDLXX (also state-tax free) to save on the expense ratio, but you have to buy in increments of $1000 on Fidelity or Schwab (can set these to auto-roll) or $100 on Treasury Direct, vs down to the penny for the money market funds.",investing

4x the market cap of Tesla. Easily, I’d rather own 1/4 of Nvidia than 1/4 of Tesla. Nvidia is very underpriced compared to Tesla. Margins, growth, leadership, future prospects - I think this is an easy call.

7x the market cap of Costco. Hard to compare this one. Such completely different industries. I like Costco. It’s got good cash flows and growth. Could be a better value, but it all depends on Nvidia’s future growth and how long it can keep doing this. I’m nodding towards owning all of Costco vs 1/7 of Nvidia. Free hot dogs for life. Sign me up.

Walmart + Amazon vs Nvidia. Again, retail consumer goods vs b2b tech company, hard to compare. My gut tells me Nvidia is a better value, but I hate Walmart and Amazon. Personal bias. Pass.

9x AMD’s market cap. Shit, Nvidia looks like a screaming buy here. Show me any metric where AMD’s numbers multiplied by 9 look better than Nvidia. 9 AMDs have slightly more cash than Nvidia, even if you subtract their debt. Big whoop. If you think AMD has a good chance to steal market share away, sure, they might be the better value. I’m calling this one close, but I’m taking NVDA at 9x the price of AMD here.

17x Goldman Sachs. I’d probably take Goldman over 1/17 of Nvidia, sure. It’s probably the safer play. Dunno. Again, it’s really hard to compare these companies, because they’re such different industries. But yeah, maybe I’d be buying banking stocks over tech right now. A lot less growth, though.

The entire German stock market vs NVDA. Way too complicated to evaluate this. It’s an interesting fun fact though.

I think Nvidia is a great company with great prospects at a maybe expensive price, but every time I think it’s probably overvalued, it continues to surpass my loftiest expectations. I’m going with it’s a “buy” but not a screaming buy. I’ve owned it for a couple of years. Never sold any. I also own Costco, AMD, and some banking stocks (not Goldman).

Absolutely fine if I’m off base, but seems to me that almost all of their revenue comes from data centers, and fundamentally, conceptually, logically etc, NVDA should not be inching on the size of (or larger than) companies that both do what it does and/or also provide the underbelly of modern society",ValueInvesting

I'll add that fractional reserve banking with a reserve of ZERO implies infinite leverage on deposits. When leverage goes south, it goes south fast.

A deposit is an unsecured zero down payment loan to the bank. Yeah, there's insurance. Insurance doesn't change the nature of the thing.

Met the old management a few times. 

Analysis is pretty good. I take a simpler valuation approach as DCFs are too sensitive to small deviations in assumptions. 

Most peers trade on 2.5-3x sales. £120m sales should be reachable under this new strategy. That implies c. £350m ev, or £370m market-cap.

Current market-cap £110m. Still plenty to go for therefore.",ValueInvesting

If the initiator of the inflation (shipping, backlog of orders as manufacturing got ramped back up) had cleared up sooner then we might have avoided most of the inflation we have gone through.

He didn't just hire rocket scientists. He was an integral part in leading the team towards the design he wanted. Obviously that means the vast majority of the nitty gritty work was done by people other than him though.

What do failures have to do with anything? They were experimental landings to figure out how best to land the rocket. NASA scientists didn't go any way with landing rockets because they've never developed them. NASA has failures all the time during testing. They hide those. Launch failures aren't allowed because, like they said, there would be lots of pushback for something so public. They definitely could have done the same approach for landings though.

chindef,1731475930,lwvih68,1gq5dii,9,"If you are open to the risk of the stock market, open up a Schwab or other brokerage account. Buy something simple like VOO. With an 8 year time horizon, I would say it’s worth putting at least some money into stocks - but there is a chance it goes down. 

If you are not open to much risk, maybe just put a portion into VOO while putting the rest into a money market fund. Money market funds earn a little more interest than high yield savings accounts. If you don’t really want any risk, then you can put all of that money into a money market fund. 

From there, make sure you are contributing sufficiently to retirement funds (401k and/or IRA). Many recommend 15% of your income, though I recommend a little more if you can do it. When you need new cars - be smart. Buy something cheap and reliable, and good on MPG. Prius, Camry, civic, etc. 
If you read on subreddits about getting out of debt and money problems, something like 90% of peoples problems are due to buying cars. If you can’t reasonably afford to buy two of the cars you are looking at up front in cash, then you cannot afford the car. Do not take out a car loan unless the interest is under 3% which is rare / unlikely. If your current vehicles are reliable, I would encourage keeping up with maintenance on the “more reliable” or more preferred car and plan to keep it until the wheels fall off. Then trade in just the less desired car - again, getting something cheap and reliable. Also, depending where you live, maybe there are public transit options. If you’re for sure renting for a while - maybe you can move to a place where one of you can easily take a train / bus to work. Then you only need 1 car! 

Also, depending on your overall life goals - there are opportunities to put less down on a house than the standard 20%. I would never do this with 7% interest rates, but if interest rates are low when you’re looking to buy then it might make sense. Just make sure you don’t spent over 30% of your after-tax income on your mortgage or you may end up in a sticky situation. Ideally, you would be able to still afford your mortgage if one of you lost your job (perhaps barely, but scraping by is better than not).

anusbarber,1731509313,lwx97s9,1gq9e52,2,"about 30% of the market is held in mutual funds or ETF's.  a little over half of that is in index funds.  and even less than that is held in total us market, sp500, or total world market.   the rest are sector indexes and other even made up indexes (see edelmen's AI index) so lets say about 10-12%.  

Worry more when its 70%

There is an issue with index funds and how they are constructed vs the rules all other mutual funds have to abide by.   In order for a mutual fund to remain ""diversified"" the percentage of its assets in a single stock is limited to 10%.   The only place this has really become an issue is in the large growth space.   the large cap index and nasdaq index's have been mopping the floor there because they are under no such restrictions.   But anyone who notes these coming issues also notes there is nothing you can do about it as an individual investor.  just keep buying the indexes.  products that say they can protect you are lying.

There are equally low cost index mutual funds though. There is traditional and Roth 401(k), and traditional and Roth IRA. it can get a little confusing if you are not familiar. Roth 401k does not have any income restrictions like Roth IRA.

2.5) The efforts in marketing and promoting Vans are active than ever now compared to anytime in the last 12 months, and we’re barely started.
3) They’re almost done with channel resets in the Americas region, so there likely would not be anymore inventory writedowns, going forward, maybe by Sept would mark the end) 
4) New CFO from Spotify which is exciting. 
5) They hinted about having found a new Vans president m, so likely will be announced next Q
6) Completed their portfolio review, so in the 4-6 months expect them to announce which brands they are selling, to pay down maturing debt year end. 

They didn’t provide any guidance likely due to CEO prefer to let results talk for themselves before giving guidance.  It is also clearly to their benefit to not provide guidance despite knowing they are seeing green shoots so that they can acquire shares at cheap prices. If Bracken makes a filing in the next quarter you know what’s up.

The turnaround is imminent, these brands are loved globally, and with the right marketing and inventory management, sales will pickup even without new product lines. Given the recent FY24 was at such a low base, I expect FY25 to show positive YoY changes and with a few more catalysts from asset sales we will revert to 20++ in no time.  If I were to dive into options I’ll only go for long dated ones expiring in Jun 2025 and beyond, because this thing could take time but I’m hopeful going forward",ValueInvesting

Empty-Adeptness-5411,1716376518,l55k5yr,1bvxmkb,1,"I have also recently done a full analysis of Basic Fit and recently opened a position.

A few points to add, for the risks side:

- A new potential risk is Planet Fitness, the dominant U.S low-cost gym chain is coming to the Spanish market.

- The have fairly high leverage, which is hopefully continuing to come down as a ratio of Net Debt/adj EBITDA, but having high Net Debt is always at risk of not being able to refinance in a Credit Crunch/Global recession/banking crisis type scenario. For me personally, I believe the current share price protects against even these worst cases (ie if forced to issue 35% new shares to raise money or forced to sell the whole company with debt, it's still unlikely to lose money from this current level IMO).

- Another recent snippet I read recently about UK gyms, is after Covid, less people are going, but the ones which are going are going more often. So BFIT will need to (and is with Premium pushing up now) adjust to this, might mean higher Yield per avg customer and slightly lower members per mature club (if this pattern follows in E.U countries)

  
On the upside, they are now going into Franchising as well starting 2025. Not unveiled their exact model of franchising yet, but will be in countries they aren't currently in, and I would hope should be a slower growth but higher margin & lower upfront cost revenue line going forward.

  
For my conservative Base case I've used 2650 clubs by 2030 (approx 25% lower than mid-point 3250), as they have missed a few recent Club opening targets along the years (and likely will miss their 2025 = 2000 club target now) , whilst generally hitting their minimum forecasted revenue growth targets.",ValueInvesting

Ehralur,1713440941,l04p0rd,1c6yfkm,15,"> Even professional active managers struggle to beat the index.

This always gets mentioned, but it's such a profoundly silly argument. Professional active managers make their money from fees, not gains. They are far more incentivized to retain clients than to maximize profits, and the easiest way to lose clients is by losing money at any given time, even if on average you outperform  the market.

In other words, money managers are more focused on not losing money than gaining money, so obviously they're going to underperform the index.

I have yet to see a proper research that analyses the returns from individual stock pickers that are actually serious long term investors, as opposed to people who gamble on individual stocks with zero research. I'm inclined to believe closer to 50% of people who really do the work at least outperform, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was even higher.

The CEO of Hertz was basically fired because of doing the TSLA fleet deal:

Since then one single stare of the company is now worth $600,000.  People have done very well with index funds for retirement savings.  You can do just as well with value investing.  Value stocks often pay a dividend.  Many people (myself included) have a signitficant income from value stocks.  Which can be used to cover living expense.  Dividend income is more stable and can last for decades.

Many people today put money in money market funds for emergency cash savings.  But if you added   a dividend fund like PFFD to the money market account you could get enough money every month to cover basic living expeneses. So If you loos your job you still have money coming in.  With a money market fund once you deplete the money it's gone.  With dividends they keep coming until you sell the shares.",investing

ZettyGreen,1713203743,kzpm9sm,1c4llvw,2,"> Who defines the yield on government bonds? State or investors?

For the USA: Both. Government sets the rate, but the price is up to the market via auction. The treasury.gov website explains how this all works, if you want to get it directly from them.

> My question is, we're talking about yield to maturity, not the coupon yield, right?

yes

> So it sounds like the investors determine the yield. But how?

The price they pay to buy say $10k of 4.5% 1yr treasuries.  Usually it auctions for right around the $10k price. At auction it could sell for 9k or it could sell for 11k, or anywhere in between.  Though again that's for dramatic effect, the prices are usually quite close to the $10k number.

 It's an auction, the price is what the market determines. Whoever wins the auction sets the price, everyone else can buy at that price.  Then it hits the secondary market, and it's trading just like every other bond. The above should have answered all your other questions. 

Note, other countries can/will do things differently.",investing

It's a good idea to at least get into the habit of investing now, even if it's a small amount. And you'll get a feel for the markets and investing and a better understanding. 

Also, try to set up automatic investments, and them increase them each time you get a raise or higher paying job. For example, if you're investing 10% of your salary and get a 3% raise, increase your investment to 11%. 

I'm not sure what automatic options your country has, or if there are retirement accounts you can invest in.

rlfcsf,1713255348,kzsv64e,1c55ny2,1,"I’m wondering if there’s a discrepancy in what you think your timeframe is and what your actual timeframe really is.  I say this for two reasons.

First you state that you sold your business a couple of years ago, which to me means Jan-Jun of 2022.  Second you state your returns are marginal.  Well I can easily simulate a standard portfolio producing marginal returns given that timeframe.  Following is an example:

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=58WrPtPe8wSttyzsBFpT6a

That portfolio between 2022 and 2024 produced a CAGR of 0.52%.  Why?  Because we had a deep correction between the 2022 and 2023.  It wasn’t until the 2023-2024 timeframe that we began to recover from the 2022 correction.

You should review your account and determine exactly when it was you put your money into the stock market because that could explain why your return is lower than what you think it should be.",investing

The question is: Will buying more shares during a downswing (like today) mean that I will have greater profits down the line? I.e. do buying more shares at a cheaper price due to a downswing mean that if the share price eventually rises, I will be better off?

I will probably exercise one contract and buy back the other leg when I close out the other positions. I intend to own shares for a long term position but for now I will just make money off the options. 

Valuation seems high to me right now, but over the long haul Im certain NVDA will be a powerful force in the new economy that is being built. Im certain that the margins it is achieving right now will go down. Im certain they will have viable competition at some point, but right now and for the foreseeable future they are in an incredibly dominant position. 

If they play their cards right they will keep that dominant position and that margin for a relatively long time, but its also quite possible that the margin will shrink if a real competing product ramps up. The timeline for when that happens is the question that has to be answered and I dont think anyone can give you a solid answer on it. No one should kid themselves and think that margin wont shrink one day. Right now though they are basically the only game in town and their primary customers are the other richest companies on Earth. This could go on for another 5 years or 20. Who knows. 

If you want to not buy NVDA my suggestion would be to look at TSM and start building a position there.

This compensation package was a cumulative total stock award over a number of years based on performance targets assigned back in 2018 and voted on by the shareholders when the stock was worth 1/10th as much.  For better or for worse Elon basically hit all the performance targets and was given the stock award for each performance target he and Tesla achieved.  Shareholders from back then are basically enjoying their stock 10x'ing and before this court fiasco and twitter last year year at one point it was 20x.  This was actually his only compensation package as he has no salary from Tesla and while this has been in the courts he actually had no new compensation package for being CEO the last few years either and had no salary.

Now it's worth 10x as much as it was in 2018 but again tesla's value could tank and it could be worth 15x less or worse in a  few years. 

The judge's ruling basically made this a bait and switch for Elon.  He did the work and was awarded the stock and now years later that stock is being removed because the value to the stock increased 10x as  result of him hitting multiple performance milestones.

As a old tesla shareholder who was there for the 2018 vote i'd vote for it again in 2018 if i knew my investment value would increase 10x.

If I have a true long position such as a diversified index fund, then that’s a long position and it’s buy-hold while adding more to it over time as a DCA.

I do buy individual stocks as investments/trades, and I keep stop losses on them. If there’s a major increase, then I’ll increase the percentage drop stop loss, but otherwise it’s 10%. 

For example, I bought CROX 5 months ago and it jumped 35%, but it sold-off last week so the trailing stop-loss kicked in at 10% decline. I bought LLY last year and it has increased by 120%, but I have a 25% trailing stop loss on that one.",investing

samir222,1713120772,kzkjuze,1c406k9,1,"First off, I think it's important to really think about how much volatility you can handle. Like, if your portfolio took a 70% dive, would you be able to hold on without freaking out and selling everything? If the thought of that kind of drop makes you nervous, it might be a sign that your current setup is a bit too risky.

I'm also a bit worried about how much your portfolio leans on speculative assets and those inflation hedges. It's great to protect against inflation, but putting so much into those kinds of investments can make things really rocky during market downturns—something I'm not sure you'd be comfortable with.

Have you thought about adding some more stable and consistently growing investments? Something like the S&P 500 ETF, VOO, could be a good fit. It's solid, reliable, and grows steadily over time. Maybe dial back on those high-risk investments to about 15% of your portfolio. This way, you're still covered if inflation spikes, but you're also set up for some good growth without all that stress.

Overall, I think balancing out those riskier bets with some proven performers could really help. Not only would it make your portfolio less of a rollercoaster, but it could also improve your returns in the long run, especially when you factor in the risks.",investing

Everyone thought it was going to go to \*bleep\* and it did very, very briefly before it snapped back. The market was fine with Trump because Trump sort of catered to them because he took credit for the successes. The biggest problem was the volatility. 

What I suspect may happen is that the markets will become very volatile again. I think Trump will try to get the feds to bring down interest rates. He pressured them when he was in office last time too. I think he thinks it will make him popular and his whole identity is wrapped up in his real estate business and he lives off debt...he's a man who loves low interest. And when interest rates are really low people look for other places to put their money - like the market. 

There are pros and cons to everything in life. I am not a fan of Trump. I won't vote for him. That being said, I suspect my investments may do very well if he is back in office.

I don't know much about bonds - so I gravitate towards bond funds instead of picking specific bonds. The exception would be treasuries since the credit quality and risk is simple to understand. 

So for target maturity bond funds - I use either Invesco Bulletshares or Blackrock iBonds - I think they are the only investment managers that currently offer target maturity bond funds.

I use a mix of investment grade and high-yield (junk) funds. 

For constant duration funds - there are a lot of them out there. I also like PIMCO active bond funds. 

But if you want treasury funds - the credit risk is the same, the difference is the type of treasuries (ie TIPS, FRNs, CMBs, etc.) and the duration. So that's really up to you. Interest rates are currently high - so now is pretty decent time to get longer duration treasury funds to lock in rates if you have a longer time horizon. 

There are also diversified bond funds based on the legacy Lehman Agg index (now called Bloomberg Aggregate Bond index). 

Regarding buying treasuries directly through Fidelity - yes Fidelity has both secondary and auction. I usually just get the secondary since it's simpler and more convenient on Fidelity.

PaleScientist4965,1716382873,l55xfvi,1cuwluf,1,"Management (David Braben) used to have a slide in their slide deck that showed their market-cap vs. all the other listed game developers. They were about 10th from bottom. They used to walk around the city saying they were heading much higher.

Like all of us they suffer over confidence. They had some 'easy-win' games and thought they could extrapolate this success. In particular they thought if they could pay for a 'brand' like Warhammer or F1 then any game would sell well, even at high price points.

Anyway, the best cure for overconfidence is failure, and they failed a lot. Hard to turn a business round too when the video games you are releasing now are the product of your decisions over the past 2 years.

In hindsight they should have stuck with the 'Planet' sims brand. Planet Water. Planet Pet. Planet Castle. You name it. They have a good brand here, and could have milked it so much further.

Anyway, I think they are approaching projects with much more humility and care now. No different from investing really. They lost their heads and discipline. Made some bad decisions.

What does that mean? It means growth. Companies are making so much money that they can charge more and saps are willing to pay it anyway, so demand remains strong even at higher prices. 

Well higher prices mean higher profits. Just because the rates are up doesn’t mean anything about the demand side immediately. It takes time for the effect of higher rates to stamp out all that buying excitement from consumers. You gotta put some people in debt and have some bills start going unpaid before inflation does more than decelerate (its been going only up just less magnitude m/m and y/y). 

So what do the rates say? When they go up, its because likely record profits are being posted and companies are making a ton of money. 

What about pausing? Some internal weakness has been identified and so the risk of hiking more is outweighed by breaking something too fast. Remember they want that “soft” landing. 

What about cutting? Something has gone wrong and there is a need to reinvigorate the economy. Spending has gone down. Delinquency’s are likely up and unemployment ticks up.

If you used  the 500k to invest into more RE properties you could get 6-8 doors giving you the same 3k in cashflow but then you also leverage the other 3 returns in RE. 2.72% in straight line depreciation tax benefit.(more if you or spouse qualify as RE professional) appreciation is leveraged to a higher return as well according to how much you put down. and principle pay down on each property which usually starts in the 2% range but increases each year according to the amortization rate.

thealphaexponent,1716421672,l58ymj5,1abkkun,1,"Actually gave a fuller answer in an X thread earlier; on the phone so please forgive any typos etc.

Reading through the short report, it seems there's a fundamental misunderstanding of the business model. Note how the angle of attack is very different from the previous report and focuses on GCT supposedly drumming up transactions via a related party transactions.

The biggest issue raised was that GCT's employees ran a lot of the storefronts on the B2B platform, but this should   not be a surprise to anyone. Many OEMs don't have the experience to run those stores and outsource - frequently to GCT. This type of outsourcing is common practice in E-commerce. Usually there'll be a separate ecosystem of vendors who specialize in these platforms, but Gigacloud don't have that scale yet, so you'd expect them to operate it directly.

There were also questions raised about how GCT is dressing things up as a 'sexy' B2B business. This makes little sense because consumer facing businesses usually grow faster and bigger (and often have higher margins than wholesalers). As highlighted above, it should be quite clear that they are mostly a B2C business, not a B2B logistics business (or even B2B sourcing platform), which would actually be far less attractive, since the margins there would typically be considerably lower than on the consumer side.

If anything, the main topic GCT was hyping up was the 'AI' aspect. It's understandable they wouldn't talk much about the B2C business since it'll bring them into potential competition with their reseller clients.

Insider selling is normal - the price coming up to this current period wasn't exactly low.

Would recommend a thorough reading of the previous study, especially the slide deck on: https://www.alphaexponent.net/p/1-jan-24-24-gigacloud

Those questions raised should mostly have been answered in that deck, it's somewhat surprising they are still being asked.

Ironically he got famous for his macro predictions though, which have been horrible in recent years (other than correctly shorting ARKK).

Great trade, over 100% increase! Except if he held for only a few more months the price would spike to over $300.

thegoodfool,1731426686,lwri58c,1gpb270,1,"That's a good point. I haven't looked at the solid data for this but off the top of my head here are some changes since 2008:

1) US Government Debt has ballooned: https://www.statista.com/chart/28393/us-public-debt/. 

**~5 Trillion in 2000 --> ~10 Trillion in 2008 --> ~35 Trillion Today (Not Pictured in Graph)**

Even when adjusted for inflation, the level of growth on our debt is growing quickly. There are lot of international countries (both emerging/developed) that are holders of US Debt. E.g: Japan is one of the biggest holders, which is why the Yen Carry Trade was so disruptive.

Some sources claim online right now that of the 35 trillion, about 15 trillion is issued to other countries and not domestic debt.

You mention percentage wise USD had larger reserve back then, but nominal levels may also matter as well. 

**2) COVID Money Printing**

I am sure that during COVID, tons of countries were looking to the IMF/World Bank for assistance (who both happen to be headquartered in DC). So money printing from the US Reserve and the Dollar was likely turned up to higher levels that we have not seen before in face of a global pandemic.

Other countries may have handled COVID differently, but many certainly not well at all. Argentina, Venezuela, Lebanon, Turkey --- all have 200+% cumulative inflation since COVID, and absolutely horrendous for those people, but as a result their currencies have strongly weakened.

>the price is most often ABOVE the intrinsic value

On a multiple basis this may look true but I would say a big chunk of the market is undervalued, you just don’t know which chunk at which time. 

If you actually do the calculation, businesses with high ROIC and high long term growth are worth ludicrous PE multiples. Things like Costco, Home Depot, L’Oreal, … would have been worth closer to 100 PE than 50 PE for many many years and you would have had a fine result if you bought them at those prices. 

That doesn’t mean it’s prudent to pay 30 times earnings today for any random business. But in hindsight many of the stocks you think are expensive today will prove to have been cheap, you just don’t know which ones.",investing

My home has a 2.93% interest rate, would sell for 510k (ish) and I owe $251k on mortgage. It needs a new roof.

A. Install a new roof ($18k = $250 monthly) and rent the full unit ($2400). Property manager ~ $240

B. Install a new roof ($18k = $250 monthly), defy the city code, and rent units separately ($3100). Property manager ~ $300

C. Sell, pay off CC, buy in PA

D. Sell, pay off CC, invest (CD or MM), rent in PA

dis-interested,1716422480,l590j7j,1cxxcdv,1,"Value investing is extremely relevant. For one, it still works - there are still people beating the index working in this way today. For another, the index really can't be the only capital allocator in the market, and the funds allocate sometimes based on emotional conditions of active investors by mere tracking of the resultant price action.


However here's the important kicker: only a minority of people who try to value invest will beat the market, because most people have severe limitations as investors, and those are largely emotional limitations. When you own the index, the index is too stupid to completely sell its stake in good businesses on temporary bad news. 


Additionally, value based funds are also pretty weak investment vehicles - they are very bad at seeing that a company trading a high multiple will nonetheless have rapid multiple expansion and so often miss the biggest opportunities.


So most people should index. If you are capable of value investing you don't need to be given permission to do so, you already know you can. ",ValueInvesting

And in all honesty time will tell of that is worth it or not. Thats also why new positions for me are infrequent so i can take my time. But it is possible and I dont get what you mean by ""being able to do it"". Its not like a trick or faith or something, youre just researching and finding value discrepencies to buy. There's no faith involved when you sit down look at information and suddenly come to realize how the pieces are lined up. That can be as simple or complicated as you want to make it, but once you see a truth like thats that. You looked, you saw treasure and grabbed it. 

If you want some examples my two largest plays in my value portfolio are Wellsfargo and live Nation. I'm not a math guy I look at the major important numbers and ratios to have a view of their money and might try to come up with a crappy share value but mostly not. I'm simplifying below but these are the concepts that help discover doscrepencies. 

Wellsfargo im in at 25, have not sold. They had bad publicity, they had a government halt of asset growth, they had covid crash. BUT their books were barely down basically negligible, so price was down 50% but they were literally worth the exact same lol. Thats a buy. 

Live nation in at 53 and holding. Covid crash dropped their business, money was tight the ceo halted his pay. But, demand didn't go down people were just stuck at home, business model didn't fail it was temporarily slowed down. They were still buying up small businesses to grow during the downtime. So the short term value was less, but the company was poised to succeed and actively succeeding, if true demand was not less then of course business would come back once covid clears. It did. Succeed

Plus a slew of smaller ones, Lloyd's bank, HSBC, Atlas Corp, amd etc etc all ""value plays"" that i considered undervalue at the time that have made me money. I have a TON that I have lost money on but most were gambles I made without proper research, without letting the facts guide my decision. If any one if us are down in the long run that's our business. I'm not. Just like sports or school we know what we bring to the table and most failures can be accounted for in that.",ValueInvesting

Literally most everything out there was cut in half ( John Deere, Amazon, Walmarts, Toyota, shell). Most all of these regained what valuation was lost within a year or two. 

Sorry looking at BOA at the time there was little likelihood the company would fail especially with the too big to fail policy at the time. 

No temporary collapsed is not hindsight. There is no logical why Walmarts is worth one trillion today and $400 billion tomorrow simply bc of what occurred in ‘08. Walmarts infrastructure remained in place, it was a temporary blip…same as the Covid crash and all the other once in a lifetime crashes that occur every few years. 

And no, it is not comparable to Lehman as they operated in different spectrums of finance and their risk profiles were completely opposite. 

Literally almost anything you bought when the Dow dropped to around 6,000 at that time, you doubled, tripled, quadrupled…your money with a few years.

If you want to be on the right side of history then gender neutral bathrooms is how it’s going to end up.  It might not be this decade, we might have split bathrooms for some time, but in the future gender neutral is how it’s going to play out.

If you do this be sure to set appropriate risk to your available funds. 

Some people trade on info - like cocoa price has shot up due to poor weather in Africa, meaning low crop harvest which has resulted in price hike due to demand outstripping supply. This kind of info can be gleamed from news, or other online sources and is typically longer term trading. 

Forex a bit different. Lots of methods to predict what's going to happen. Trial and error to find out what works for you. Best trialled with a demo account to avoid losing money. Suggest some free online training to understand this better before you even use a demo account.

FreakyDancerCC,1731445127,lwt60wj,1gpu8i2,4,"Primarily it depends what you mean by “bonds”?

If you’re talking about longer duration lower grade corporate bonds then yes you’re right, they’re risky, correlated with shares and have lower risk adjusted returns.

If you’re talking about shorter duration government backed treasuries and gilts then they do have a place.

Historically they have had lower volatility than shares and relatively low correlation with them as well. This means that when shares drop, bonds are less likely to be dropping, and may in fact be doing quite well.

Thus in a portfolio they protect against share underperformance and volatility, at the cost of some upside to portfolio performance.

“When the market crashes, just buy more… what am I missing?”

Where is your money going to come from to buy more? If you’ve got spare cash then by definition you’re not 100% invested in shares. If you’re going to keep money spare in cash to invest, then you may as well put it in short term high quality bonds which historically have done better against inflation.

If you have money in bonds and rebalance on the way up, when shares crash and you rebalance you have the resources to buy the dip and so recover quicker than someone who does not.

When the stock market is underperforming, given its historic volatility, portfolios with bonds in them will do better than portfolios without them. The worse the performance the better the higher proportion of bonds performs relative to pure shares.

As the stockmarket performance improves towards average gradually portfolios with larger ratios of shares start to outperform those with smaller ratios of shares until eventually the performance of a pure share portfolio is superior.

However when the stockmarket performs better than average you don’t lose out that much compared to pure shares portfolios. 

So bonds give you more downside protection than they cost you in loss of upside.

The last thing to point out is that humans are notoriously inaccurate in predicting how they’ll behave in situations that they’ve not been in before. It’s easy to talk a good game on the internet saying that they’ll just buy more, but I’m willing to bet that most of them wouldn’t be doing that if the S&P has been underperforming for a decade.",investing

Our insurance is switching to an open access model. No referrals needed and we can get services wherever we want. Trying to decide between HSA HDHP vs PPO. I’ve always selected PPO, but without much consideration.

I go to doctor 2 or 3 times a year for bloodwork and have two prescriptions I take daily with a 90-day supply each. Wife almost never goes to doctor and, if she does, it is usually to the urgent care. We do have a new baby but praying nothing major happens. If I get sick, I usually go to urgent care, too, if I cannot ride it out.

Here’s the facts:

Family (me + spouse + children)
28M, 29F, 12 week old baby (no health issues as of yet)
PPO

Deductible: $1,000 individual and $2,000 family
Maximum Out-of-Pocket: $2,000 individual and $4,000 family
PCP Co-pay: $35
Specialist Co-pay: $35
Generic drugs: $20 co-pay
Preventive services: No charge
20% co-insurance (assuming this refers to after deductible has been met?)
Paycheck premium (26 paychecks): $92.42 (or $200.24/mo)
HDHP HSA

Deductible: $3,500 individual and $7,000 family
Maximum Out-of-Pocket: $3,500 individual and $7,000 family
PCP: 0% co-insurance after deductible
Specialist: 0% co-insurance after deductible
Generic drugs: Deductible and co-insurance
Preventive services: No charge
0% co-insurance (assuming this refers to after deductible has been met?)
$8,550 2025 HSA maximum for family
Employer contributes $5,000 to this amount
$75 per paycheck


Should be in 22% tax bracket, married filing jointly. Wife does not work. SAHM.

I hear that with kids, PPO is usually better until they get to at least 5 years old (or, conservatively, until they become teenagers). I’ve also read that HDHP HSA still usually takes the cake regardless of circumstances. Is the $5,000 employer contribution bad, ok, good, or really good?

I am very interested in maxing out the HSA, investing it, and saving receipts moving forward (forever it seems). The company we use for the investment portion has some ETF and mutual fund options, and looks to be through Vanguard. Maybe 12 choices total. Lowest expense ratio they offer is VTI ETF at 0.030. Highest expense ratio option is 0.100 for the VWO emerging markets ETF.

I tend to write them pretty far out of the money (meaning, stock would have to drop considerably, say 15-20%) for them to get called (meaning, I would have to buy them). I’ve been doing this for about 5 years, and I’d say 80% of my puts do not get called. The ones that do ended up being pretty solid buys, entering positions in stocks I wanted to own at relatively low entry points. I can’t say this is like a GREAT strategy (you have short term capital gains, you have unlimited downside and limited upside, etc) but I will say I have enjoyed it and also do tend to make a nice premium overall while just holding my overall portfolio as is.",investing

but_why_doh,1716390205,l56gu7s,1cxq9rw,1,"Again, a lot of this is because of decades of underinvestment in R&D. Pat has barely been CEO for 3 years, and in that time he's done a lot to correct the ship, but it takes time. Also, pretty much all the stability issues are caused by MBs giving near unlimited power to intel CPUs, which will more than definitely cook a CPU without proper cooling. The stability issues have been really overblown by the community, as the vast majority of people have voltage restrictions on their CPUs, and laptops not allowing for that much power to go into CPUs. The big reason why OEMs are switching is because when Ryzen came out, OEMs started signing long term deals. It's likely that any market share changing deal happened during 10th and 11th gen, as OEMs take quite a long time to put a CPU into their devices, especially from a partner they don't usually work with. 

The biggest reason why Intel chips have fallen behind in DC is because they haven't shipped nearly as many new Xeon chips. AMD Epyc has proven to be very good, but the shift Intel is making in how they make chips will help a lot(Namely IDM 2). It's also worth noting that, unlike consumers, most large companies run on time tables, and they order chips on cycles. AMD customers just so happen to be in cycle(most signed on when Ryzen was coming out), while Intel partners are not. They will have to replace their CPUs eventually, as the covid racks are nearing their end of life. 

Again, this all depends on what you think of Pat and co. It's worth noting that, even with revenue from 80B to 55B, they still make more than double AMD does in revenue, and Intel simply has longer standing relationships with OEMs. Overall, to me it's a no brainer.",ValueInvesting

Cool, and you're supposed to know when to buy exactly at the bottom? By your logic you'd likely be buying when they're down even 25% and immediately suffer another major loss in the coming weeks.

How many Japanese blue chip companies declined in value by 50% in 1990 and are only now returning to their same values thirty years later? 

If you bought the S&P500 after it had declined in value by 50% during the great depression (such an easy time to buy by your logic), you'd still fall **another** 65% in the coming year on your investment. After some ups and downs, 20 years later you'd still be break even... buying at the 50% ""discount"". 

>There is no logical why Walmarts is worth one trillion today and $400 billion tomorrow simply bc of what occurred in ‘08.

Walmart can't make money if it's suppliers are all going bankrupt, the supply chain is disrupted, it's consumers are so broke they're switching to rice and beans for every meal. I don't know if you were investing in 2008 but there was legitimate fear it was going to be a great depression situation where the financial collapse would leave to ramifications that would last for 20+ years. Discount future returns over that period and yes the value of Walmart can absolutely justifiably drop 50%. It was not known if it was a ""temporary blip"".

It's not however like pressing on the accelerator. The housing market for one. These little rates you could actually argue are inflationary because it's keeping the average person from being able to purchase a property at a reasonable price. The fact that property prices are not dropping due to lack of inventory is something else that is a historical anomaly when rates go up. What would be absolutely wild is if they start cutting rates and inflation goes down and there's an argument to be made that it would happen because some of the biggest inputs to inflation happen to be housing.

ATravellingScot,1731510454,lwxcl2s,1gq9jln,1,"Hello,

I'm a UK citizen, I've been using Nutmeg for around 6/7 years now, which manage my portfolio. Their fees are high but I've never had any complaints, especially with simple returns of around 25%. I am very much looking for something similar in the USA - very hands off, and happy to pay higher fees. I currently have about $20k in Schwab's SWVXX so basically anything hands off that can provide me better than their 5% after fees, I'd be happy with.

To stress, I really don't want to get too involved in this (no offense whatsoever to all of you who can make your money go way further), I personally just want as hands off an approach as possible.

More details below in line with your forums guidance

* How old are you?
   * What country do you live in? 32, USA (UK citizen on current J1 visa, transferring to H-1B soon)
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
   * $60k likely rising to circa $100k in June (job change but remaining in USA)
* What are your objectives with this money?
   * Travel, easy access to the cash, no particular long term goals.
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
   * Ideally easy access like Nutmeg (3-7 business days) but not crucial. I may also consider removing the money from the US in the next 3-4 years unless it's a huge burden/loss due to tax. I just don't fancy filing US taxes every year when I eventually leave the country
* What is your risk tolerance?
   * 6-8 by Nutmeg's/other financial risk calculator's 10 point scale
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)
   * Nothing in the US apart from SWVXX. Other investment portfolio in the UK.
* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?
   * None (UK student loan technically but this is circa $20k and not a capital debt in the UK, it's a government scheme)
* And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.
   * As I said, hands off as possible. Quick access to cash not a must, but would be nice. I haven't stated this, but I'm aware of most of the tax implications with my UK/US holdings.",investing

For the financial multiples, lower is better.  A P/E of 10 is always preferred over a P/E of 100.  If you were to own a part of a company that made you $1 every year, would your rather pay $10 for that $1 in earnings, or $100?  Obviously, you'd rather pay $10, so we favor low P/E, P/S, P/B, P/FCF, and EV/EBITDA.

For Shareholder Yield, higher is better.  Would you rather be paid out 2% per year, or 0.2%?  Shareholder Yield is a little more nuanced than that, because they may have zero dividend but perform large buy-backs, buying up 5% of the stock and reducing the float.  After buybacks, there are fewer shares that represent ownership of the company yet the company has not lost any value, so the intrinsic value of each share is increased, effectively yielding the shareholder extra value, same as a dividend.",investing

Another plus is that you can purchase in $100 denoms versus the $1k denoms when trying to buy treasuries through a brokerage.

They have no intentions of ever selling their physical assets, and every time taxes are raised, they raise rent.  Groceries go up, they raise rent.  They and even larger investors are doing it to insulate themselves from the rapid devaluation of the dollar.  They don't need huge sums of money all at once, they just need to protect themselves from wild currency dilution and market volatility.  It's a great strategy, BUT it's not one that younger working class people can compete with.  For the very reason you noted.  They can't build up the money, and the bankers won't loan them the money at those rates.  First the starter homes were bought up, then almost all available lots and land.  New HOA neighborhoods were built with cramped housing, ""selling the illusion of home ownership"", which just means a clever way of charging rent forever with none of the responsibilities.   Now, all that remains are very high priced condos, which are either managed by property management companies for the actual owners and rented steeply OR huge investors own them and collect steep HOA fees as well.  Of ALL of those types, who have been buying up all of the properties, not a single one is interested in selling.  Hell, I'm not even in the game, and I'm never going to sell our property.  I'll give it to our kids first, and they'll just rent it out like everyone else is doing.  Why?  Because the markets, other investments, are getting wiped down faster than the dollar was devalued right now.  If they tables ever turn, people might reconsider, but for the foreseeable future everyone seems to be celebrating the rate hikes, and so this is where we are now.  A whole generation of workers get to be renters for their lifetime.",stocks

billygage10140,1731538065,lwzufh2,1gprzr9,2,"I manage all my own portfolios and investments so adding value through investment tilt based primarily on economic and market data. Creating a portfolio based on overall risk and then allocating that risk to maximize return with limiting risk. Examples would be tilting more towards US Large Growth rather than International Growth for the last 10 years. Say a TDF has 35% in International I may lower that to 15% and reallocate the other 20% somewhere else. Flip side is at some point when economic signs point to out performance for International I can go 45% or higher. Small cap growth has been hit hard since interest rates have gone higher and been an under allocated portion of portfolios. 

For bonds it’s allocating to tilts like High Yield and Corporate Treasuries the last few years rather than AGG, BND(X), IEF, TLT etc. There are some active bond funds that generally outperform their peer group and Index and are in the top 10 percentile for the last 1/3/5/10 years. Those consistent funds are ones I like because even with a higher ER the overall return to my clients is usually net 2-3% higher. Back at the end of 2021 when the Fed said they were going to start raising interest rates, I took off duration and small cap growth and reallocated to high yield and value equites. Now I’m not perfect and seeing high yield bonds decrease by 8% in 2022 wasn’t good but it was a lot better than AGG (-13%) and TLT (-31%) or IEF (-15%). 

Most often I like to pair investments within a portfolio for risk balance. If I add risk high yield then add treasuries for risk free return. That combination might have the same risk but slightly different returns.",investing
