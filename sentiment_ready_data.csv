1e7tfbb,"40K in traditional IRA. Should I transfer to my Roth IRA?. Potentially relevant details: 36 yo, married, 24% income tax bracket. 

Through previous work 401Ks, I have about 40K in a Traditional IRA. Wondering if I should transfer to my Roth IRA, which has around 20K in it. 

I was told by a FA to not transfer because the taxes would’ve been penal at the time. I can afford to pay it now. But it is nice to have a chunk of cash in case life happens. 

But my plan is to max out my Roth IRA every year and kind of treat the Traditional IRA like it isn’t there. I also contribute 15% into a work Roth 401K. 

I’ve read that future income is important in this. I work in a pretty volatile industry. So it wouldn’t surprise me at any point I’m told my services are no longer needed. And there wouldn’t be a guarantee that I ever find work in it again. But that also doesn’t mean I won’t have 25 more years if that makes sense. It’s just kind of a random, volatile industry. 

I’m sure this gets asked a lot. But any advice would be appreciated.",40k traditional ira transfer roth ira potentially relevant details 36 yo married 24 income tax bracket previous work 401ks 40k traditional ira wondering transfer roth ira 20k told fa transfer taxes ve penal time afford pay nice chunk cash case life happens plan max roth ira year kind treat traditional ira like isn t contribute 15 work roth 401k ve read future income important work pretty volatile industry wouldn t surprise point m told services longer needed wouldn t guarantee find work doesn t mean won t 25 years makes sense s kind random volatile industry m sure gets asked lot advice appreciated,post,investing,2024-07-20 11:23:17,1.71,FA,1,NASDAQ,1041,201,2024-07-20,11,Saturday

1eac2n8,"Selling of 401k Stock vs Vested stock. Question for the collective. My company (a fortune 10) offers a 401k which I've been invested in for well over 15 years, in that 401k they are heavily invested well... in themselves.. They also provide stock as part of your bonus each year, so as a result I have a bunch of stock in the 401k and a bunch of stock in my normal portfolio.

  
I'm over invested and continue to find ways to diversify.  Stock is at an all time high and is continuing to climb.

  
Speaking with my financial advisor on possible areas to spread out, he recommended liquidating just the company stock out of my 401k and into another fund we've been discussing over the past few months.

That said, I still have a lot of fully vested stock in my personal stock portfolio from years of bonuses. About 9 months ago, I sold off a lot of my ""Long Held"" (vs short) company stock. But i still have triple the long held stock (in value) in my portfolio vs my 401k.

So my question is (not that i doubt my advisor he's done very well for me) is it better to sell off whats in the 401k and roll it into another fund (which from what i read doesnt take a tax hit but i could be wrong) or should i liquidate more of my long held stock in my portfolio and take the capital gains hit.

In my mind it seems like its a wash except the outcome is more diversification either way I choose.",selling 401k stock vs vested stock question collective company fortune 10 offers 401k ve invested 15 years 401k heavily invested provide stock bonus year result bunch stock 401k bunch stock normal portfolio m invested continue find ways diversify stock time high continuing climb speaking financial advisor possible areas spread recommended liquidating company stock 401k fund ve discussing past months said lot fully vested stock personal stock portfolio years bonuses 9 months ago sold lot long held vs short company stock triple long held stock value portfolio vs 401k question doubt advisor s better sell s 401k roll fund read nt tax hit wrong liquidate long held stock portfolio capital gains hit mind like wash outcome diversification way choose,post,investing,2024-07-23 16:23:28,26.86,,0,,1388,267,2024-07-23,16,Tuesday

1ahvyml,"Is a whole life insurance policy a good place to park money in for people under 30?. I am looking for places to park money, mostly gains I earn from trading options on the stock market. The idea is to hide money from myself in vehicles where it will be both hard and impractical to cash out of but at the same time, said vehicles provide me with the flexibility to take loans out against them.  
My basic understanding is that term life insurance is useless because everyone in my family lives to 80+ years old and I am under 30 so a 30 year policy will result in lost money. But a whole life policy allows me the flexibility to take loans against it and it will always pay out when I die. I have no children but want 2-3 in the future.  
I would ideally want to deposit at least $300 monthly, if not weekly. I want the freedom to determine how much I deposit which is why I ideally want a low monthly rate. I will increase it as my profits increase. I am looking for a $1-2m policy. I would also like some kind of exposure to the market with this policy (similar to 401k or index funds especially those with some dividend payouts).

So, my question is; if somebody invests in said company, sells after the share price is super high, and then reinvests all the profits (and all the characters money); in real life, what would the ramifications be? Namely, these values are very high, hundreds of millions, what would happen if somebody random decided to invest $100mm, or more, in a company?

1ajqqgz,"Is renting better than buying a home if a person is planning to ""die with zero"" with no wife and no kids?. Here is the scenario:  
  
Am currently 24; life expectancy is about 75. I estimate about 50 years left to live, which is about 600 months. So 600 monthly rent payments instead of buying a house.  
  
Everyone in my family continues to tell me that buying is always superior to renting no matter the scenario. I'm not quite sure if this applies to my plan.  
  
I understand that buying real estate is powerful for many reasons (5x leverage 20% down, tax advantages, etc.) but what if:  
  
1. I plan to not marry or have any kids.  
  
2. I plan to ""die with zero"" meaning I want to die with as close to 0 dollars as possible since I'm not having any kids to pass any assets down to.  
  
3. I want to ""retire"" from working a job as early as possible.  
  
4. I want to have as little unnecessary stress as possible throughout the lifetime.  
  
  
The money that would have gone into the down payment and monthly mortgage would go to the SP500. Would it be reasonable to think that the SP500 will appreciate more than the real estate property? Or am I misunderstanding?  
  
My thinking with this is:  
  
1. SP500 and renting will have a lot less maintenance (no HVAC guy, no plumber, etc.)  
  
2. No property tax  
  
3. What's the point in building equity in this house if I will not pass it down to anyone? I don't want to die with 1-2 million dollars worth of house.  
  
Some possible arguments I can come up against my own point:  
  
1. monthly mortgage is fixed but rent increases in dollar amount over time (but also take into consideration that SP500 also increases in dollar amount over time)  
  
2. Possibly borrow against value of the home?  
  
3. A 20% down payment allows you to leverage (ex. You put down 200k to control a 1m asset. That's like 5x leverage and you de-leverage with each monthly payment)

1akol5d,"Thinking of buying Japanese Stock. Can't decide whether to make settled currency in Dollars or Yen. Hi.  


I asked a similar question a week or so ago, but I think I misunderstood what my brokerage is offering, so I want to see if people here can explain better. I thought having settled currency in Yen was better because it would raise my floor at the risk of lowering my ceiling due to currency fluctuations. But the brokerage person just told me something different (even though another person told me something else a couple of weeks ago when I called).  


So I am thinking of buying Japanese Stock with my US brokerage account. My brokerage account offers settled currency in US Dollars and Japanese Yen.  


I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense have settled currency in Dollars or Yen.   


I thought having settled currency in dollars  meant that my investment in the site dashboard would show the Dollar equivalent when it comes to gains/ losses. So for example if the investment in yen went up 20%, but currency fluctuated where the yen got stronger, my actual investment gain in dollar might only be 15%. Whereas if it was in yen, then i would get the full 20% gain, and I only have the currency risk if i choose to convert.  


As my brokerage account is in US, it is probably more convenient to have things in dollars so that if i sell the investment, i don't need to convert to buy something like an ETF?  


Whereas if it is settled in Yen, I would have to convert back? The way the brokerage people told me was that the settled in yen make sense if you have yen in your account. I don't, but I can use the currency exchange feature to get the yen anyways.  


Does it actually matter in terms of potential gains/ losses or other Pros and Cons? The approximate exchange rate is 1 USD to 150 yen.. That is quite lopsided to the US Dollar... I do expect the yen to strengthen even if it is 1 USD to 120 or 130 yen in the future for example.   


TLDR: does it matter if i make my settled currency in Dollar vs Yen in regards to potential gains/ losses?  


Is there any pro or con that I am not aware of in buying in US dollar or Yen?

1f2kctk,"Death and Taxes. Service Corporation International $SCI. Hello, 

in 1989, Peter Lynch wrote about Service Corporation International in this book, ""One up on Wall Street"". This a slow growth Funeral Services company, and he considered this company a very good investment, and he mentioned it in chapter 8 under ""The Perfect Stock"". 

I wanted to find out, 30+ years on, whether this company is still a good investment candidate.  

I have decided to do up a datasheet +  a Lynch Stock-chart and copy and paste an excerpt from the book  on SCI.  

=============

**1. The Chapter 8 like ""The Perfect Stock""**

3. Also included is an attempt to do up a **Lynch Stock Chart**, which consists of the share price and the earnings line (which is in this pegged to the ""Personal Services Industry Ratio of 18"". If you want to find out more about this type of chart,[ see this previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ezef00/peter_lynch_stock_chart_value_line/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  

  
=============

**A couple of comment of SCI:**

- This is a slow growth company and the business follows the demographic growth of the population. The company is also buying and consolidating funeral homes, and also buying back massive amount of their stock. In the last 10 years, they retired 30% of the outstanding shares, see the spreadsheet in 2. 

- The business is boring, top line sales growth is around 5% CAGR, but EPS growth is around 6.5% to 12%  on a forward basis, in the past they have managed 9% - 20% annualized growth. 

- Because the business is stable, the company has debt of around 9 nears of earnings. The cash flow is also very stable, the Free Cash flow margin is around 12-13%. 

- I did a reverse NPV and worked out that at the current price of around $77, the market is expecting an EPS growth of only 5.5% a year.

- My blended valuation puts the company around $63-$69 which isnt far off from the share price, Morningstar's quantitiative valuation puts it around $73

- The company pays a dividend of only 1.5% but has been growing the dividend every year at around 13%.

- In terms of total shareholder return, i calculate it as Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth, which is around 9-10% a year. This a general guideline of what to expect if you were to invest in $SCI.

(7) THERE’S SOMETHING DEPRESSING ABOUT IT

In this category my favorite all-time pick is Service Corporation International (SCI), which also has a boring name. I got this pick from George Vanderheiden, the onetime Fidelity electronics analyst who’s done a great job running the Fidelity Destiny Fund.

Now, if there’s anything Wall Street would rather ignore besides toxic waste, it’s mortality. And SCI does burials.

For several years this Houston-based enterprise has been going around the country buying up local funeral homes from the mom-and-pop owners, just as Gannett did with the small-town newspapers. SCI has become a sort of McBurial. It has picked up the active funeral parlors that bury a dozen or more people a week, ignoring the smaller one-or two-burial parlors.

At last count the company owned 461 funeral parlors, 121 cemeteries, 76 flower shops, 21 funeral product-and-supply manufacturing centers, and 3 casket distribution centers, so they’re vertically integrated. They broke into the big-time when they buried Howard Hughes.

In April, BIG increased its borrowing capacity by $200 Million. About three quarters of its debt is not long term, but lease obligations. These should be reduced as stores are closed.

1euva1z,"Inflation and declining indexes are double edged advantage to the buyer of stock indexes.. # Declining Market in an Inflationary Environment: A Dual Advantage for Investors

A declining market in an inflationary environment can be intimidating, but it also offers unique opportunities for investors who can navigate the situation strategically. The concept of a ""double-edged sword"" in this context means that both aspects of the scenario—declining prices and inflation—can work to your advantage if you understand how to capitalize on them. Here's how:

# 1. Understanding the Decline: Why Markets Fall in an Inflationary Environment

* **Rising Interest Rates**: In response to inflation, central banks typically raise interest rates to control price increases. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for companies, which can slow down expansion and reduce future earnings prospects. This often leads to a decline in stock prices as investors anticipate lower growth.
* **Investor Sentiment**: Inflation erodes purchasing power, and when combined with rising interest rates, it can dampen consumer spending and business investment. Investors might react by selling off stocks, leading to a market decline. The immediate reaction to inflation is often negative, reflecting fears of reduced profitability and economic slowdown.

# 2. The First Edge: Buying at Lower Prices

* **Discounted Valuations**: As markets decline, stock prices often fall below their intrinsic value. Inflation-induced sell-offs can cause temporary dislocations where high-quality companies are undervalued. For investors, this means the opportunity to purchase stocks at prices significantly lower than their long-term value.
* **Enhanced Future Returns**: The principle of buying low and selling high is fundamental to investing. In an inflationary downturn, when prices are depressed, entering the market can set you up for substantial gains when the market recovers. The lower your entry price, the higher your potential returns when prices eventually rise.
* **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: If you invest regularly, a declining market allows you to accumulate more shares at lower prices. This reduces your average cost per share, positioning you to benefit more when the market rebounds. In an inflationary environment, where prices may be volatile, this strategy can be particularly effective.

# 3. The Second Edge: Inflation’s Effect on Revenues and Earnings

* **Revenue Growth Through Inflation**: While inflation can initially hurt stock prices, it also leads to higher nominal revenues for companies. As prices for goods and services rise, companies typically adjust their pricing to reflect these increases. This means that over time, businesses can generate more revenue simply because they are charging more.
* **Earnings Growth**: Companies that can manage their costs effectively and pass on higher prices to consumers will not only maintain their profit margins but may also see their earnings grow in nominal terms. Even though inflation might reduce the real value of money, the increase in nominal earnings can drive stock prices higher once the market stabilizes.
* **Inflationary Tailwinds**: If inflation is persistent across the economy, it often means that there is more money circulating. This increased money supply can lead to higher overall demand, supporting company sales even as prices rise. As companies report higher earnings due to inflation, their stock prices are likely to recover and even exceed previous levels.

# 4. The Broader Economic Context: Inflation Is Everywhere

* **Inflation Across Sectors**: Inflation doesn't just affect one part of the economy; it's pervasive. While certain sectors (like consumer staples or energy) may benefit more directly, inflationary pressures generally increase the nominal value of goods and services across the board. This widespread impact means that most companies will eventually adjust their pricing, leading to revenue growth.
* **Real Asset Appreciation**: Stocks represent ownership in real companies that produce good",inflation declining indexes double edged advantage buyer stock indexes declining market inflationary environment dual advantage investors declining market inflationary environment intimidating offers unique opportunities investors navigate situation strategically concept double edged sword context means aspects scenario declining prices inflation work advantage understand capitalize s 1 understanding decline markets fall inflationary environment rising interest rates response inflation central banks typically raise interest rates control price increases higher interest rates borrowing expensive companies slow expansion reduce future earnings prospects leads decline stock prices investors anticipate lower growth investor sentiment inflation erodes purchasing power combined rising interest rates dampen consumer spending business investment investors react selling stocks leading market decline immediate reaction inflation negative reflecting fears reduced profitability economic slowdown 2 edge buying lower prices discounted valuations markets decline stock prices fall intrinsic value inflation induced sell offs cause temporary dislocations high quality companies undervalued investors means opportunity purchase stocks prices significantly lower long term value enhanced future returns principle buying low selling high fundamental investing inflationary downturn prices depressed entering market set substantial gains market recovers lower entry price higher potential returns prices eventually rise dollar cost averaging invest regularly declining market allows accumulate shares lower prices reduces average cost share positioning benefit market rebounds inflationary environment prices volatile strategy particularly effective 3 second edge inflation s effect revenues earnings revenue growth inflation inflation initially hurt stock prices leads higher nominal revenues companies prices goods services rise companies typically adjust pricing reflect increases means time businesses generate revenue simply charging earnings growth companies manage costs effectively pass higher prices consumers maintain profit margins earnings grow nominal terms inflation reduce real value money increase nominal earnings drive stock prices higher market stabilizes inflationary tailwinds inflation persistent economy means money circulating increased money supply lead higher overall demand supporting company sales prices rise companies report higher earnings inflation stock prices likely recover exceed previous levels 4 broader economic context inflation inflation sectors inflation doesn t affect economy s pervasive certain sectors like consumer staples energy benefit directly inflationary pressures generally increase nominal value goods services board widespread impact means companies eventually adjust pricing leading revenue growth real asset appreciation stocks represent ownership real companies produce good,post,ValueInvesting,2024-08-17 23:34:20,9.02,,0,,4091,606,2024-08-17,23,Saturday

1excjcc,"Coca Cola Icecek - one to watch. Coca cola Icecek is a Turkish coke bottler with exclusive rights to bottle in 10-15 countries in the Middle East. Going for 8-9 times earnings now and has dropped a good amount recently. They just announced earnings and lowered volume guidance slightly. The market didn’t like it evidently - the stock fell 6-7%. 

This is a good business with a big moat. If the stock price keeps getting hit, it’s a no brainer to go in and buy. Full disclosure I own the company, bought it back when it was 6 times earnings but haven’t bought lately because it spiked to a value that was harder to stomach than 6x. 

Key points are the following:

1. Huge moat - only they can bottle Coca Cola in 10-15 countries in the Middle East 

2. Coca Cola owns a big chunk of the company

3. Coca Cola is an incredible brand that will always be around

4. Many of the countries that the company has the bottling rights to are GROWING in population. Over time this should result in more Coca Cola products being consumed

5. Inflation resistant - if inflation is high, they just raise prices. Consumption is relatively predictable 

6. The business operates in many different countries, providing some diversification outside of Turkey

I’m not buying right now but I’m going in if it becomes 5-6x earnings. You can get the shares through fidelity - ticker is COLZF. Here’s a link to their latest earnings release if interested.

1ez4tc0,"Thoughts on Haidilao. Haidilao is a Chinese hot pot restaurant chain that is synonymous with hot pot in China. They have \~1400 locations and offer hot pot as an 'experience' more than a place to just consume calories. They have their own boy band, dancing servers, and amenities like manicures for people in their huge lines.

They went public in 2018 and went on a store opening binge, opening hundreds of stores a year, even through COVID. They assumed that it would be temporary and short-lived, so even during COVID they were opening 1 store a day.

Unfortunately, this rapid expansion and China's zero COVID policy caught up to them, and they stopped making any net income. They had to take on tons of debt, and slim down their business, eventually closing \~300 locations and 'right sizing' the chain. This largely wrapped up in 2023 where they went back to making a great net income, with a net income of 4.5B RMB on 41.5B RMB of revenue (11% net margin). They pay a massive 6.7% dividend. They've focused on paying down debt the last few years, and 'recovering' from their binge. Debt is now a very manageable amount, and not a concern (in my opinion).

A human comes and takes orders initially, but at most locations, you order on a tablet, and a robot will bring you your food later. The back of the restaurant is also highly automated, and in areas with dense restaurants, some food is prepped offsite.

Their business model is about as simple as it gets for a restaurant. The only thing they 'cook' is the broth, which they can make in huge quantities. The rest is literally providing you with raw ingredients to cook yourself. If we put on our 'investor thinking cap', their business model is to basically 'rent' you a table, bring you raw ingredients, and have you cook it yourself. Because their revenue per table, and turnover rate is so high, they only pay \~1% of their revenue in rent, so even this is not much of a cost. Their capital costs consist of basically buying some tables for a restaurant, and they are extremely CAPEX light. I calculate that stores pay for themselves, in revenue at least, within \~1 month of opening.

Although they've shown the ability to open hundreds of stores in a year, their focus for 2024 is:

1. Slowly expand overseas in the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe opening only 10 stores per year abroad. I believe they could far exceed this and still be quite profitable, but they are probably in the 'infrastructure building' phase where they are making the cookie cutter mold perfect, rather than deploying it as fast as possible.
2. They are experimenting with a new Hailao brand that is cheaper than Haidilao, but also lacks some of the performances, perks, etc... Hailao is simply a place to get hot pot, it is generally around half the price for the ingredients, but since it's so much cheaper, people order much more food and bills are usually only 23% lower than Haidilao. Of course, it is also cheaper for Haidilao to run, and represents a great way to expand to more budget conscious consumers.
3. They are offering franchising in China now, for the first time, and experimenting with this for new locations.
4. They are trying to expand into Tier 3 Chinese cities, and increase density in existing Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities.

As for political risk, I can't imagine US/China trade tensions extending to a hot pot restaurant chain. I view the risk of tarrifs as being quite low, as opposed to something like steel manufacturing, EVs, national security industries, etc... I just can't see anyone on either side having strong opinions about a hot pot chain.

They are currently valued at a PE of 13, which seems incredibly low for a business like theirs. Their stock is trading near all time lows. Mid-year financials are going to be reported soon, and we are 8 months past the last reporting period - so today's PE ratio might already be under 13 considering the last report was for the period ending December 31, 2023.

1ez5wkw,"McDonald's? Hideously overpriced or am I just underestimating their moat?. Hi everyone. Beginner investor and first time poster in an investment sub. Please be kind, but honest.

I know this is titled ""Stock Analysis"", but basically I've looked at the basic fundamentals of McDonald's because I haven't learned how to apply Benjamin Graham's formula yet. Truth be told, I haven't made it to chapter 11 of the book yet, but this matters to me because my wife has been sitting on a giant stake in McDonald's because investing is not her deal, and she wants me to figure out what to do with it, because investing is my deal. I have the time, I'm developing the temparament, I have the analytical ability, I have a healthy fear of the unkown which I mitigate by learning everything I can before I make a decision, and then making sure I have a factor of safety built in to cover the known and unkown unknowns. I'm the lady who spends a week researching microwaves before buying one because I want to maximize quality and value.

  
Sorry, that intro was a bit too long, but basically, my wife and I have a fortune in McDonald's, and I'm almost but not quite at the level of being afraid McDonald's could file Chapter 11 before I make it to Chapter 11 of The Intelligent Investor, and here's why.

1. Stocks in general are trading at much higher valuations than what I'm comfortable with.

2. It seems like we're heading for either a recession or the bursting of an AI tech bubble within days to months but I'd be shocked if one or both of these didn't happen within 18 months.

3. McDonald's is at a P/E > 25 which is about the max I feel comfortable spending on a large cap growth stock, but I don't believe McDonald's is a growth stock, but as you will see in a later bullet, McDonald's thinks they're a growth stock.

4. Much more important/troubling to me is the debt/""literally anything"" ratio (debt/equity, debt/capital, etc.) and the price to book. Price to book is severely negative because they have more liabilities than assets.

5. Allegedly their problem is they've gotten too expensive and ""those damn Gen Z kids"" just don't appreciate a good fast burger at a cheap price.

6. The way McDonald's seems to be addressing this problem and their 2 consecutive earnings misses is by investing a billion dollars, which they apparently borrowed at God knows what kind of bond rates, to open a fuck ton of new restaurants in Ireland and the UK (thus they are behaving as if they are a growth stock, but they're already a giant) not to mention that part of the reason they 

7. A ton of Wallstreet analysts are extremely bullish on it, but among a couple of the firms I have the most confidence in, the one whose analysis I find to be the most disciplined and value/fundamental based has them rated as sell. Among the firms I depend upon to help me with my own analysis, this firm also has a very high rating of being right more often when it comes to fast food restaurants (as rated by yet another analytical firm I rely upon because I'm just as disciplined in who I listen to as I am in how I analyze a product because I see an analyst/firm as a product/tool)

8. There is very small but growing short interest in McDonald's stock.

9. Their bonds are rated BBB+ which is still ""investment grade"" but isn't that a bit low for a company who has done so well for so long?

1ez5yyl,"Analyzing Market Reactions During Economic Downturns. Emotions significantly influence stock market fluctuations, influencing investor behavior and decision-making. Various emotions, from optimism to fear, shape investment strategies and market trends.

**Key Emotional Factors**

**(1) Fear and Panic**

Fear can lead to massive stock price declines, often triggered by investors anticipating unfavorable economic conditions or market downturns, resulting in a panic-induced asset liquidation.

**(2) Greed and Overconfidence**

During economic booms, greed can lead to inflated stock prices due to overconfidence in market stability and future growth prospects, thereby artificially increasing asset values.

**(3) Optimism and Pessimism**

Positive economic news boosts market participation and higher stock prices, while pessimistic outlooks reduce investment and prices decline due to negative economic indicators.

**(4) Herd Mentality**

Investors' herd mentality can amplify market trends, leading to pronounced fluctuations, such as asset prices rising beyond intrinsic value but crashing when sentiment shifts.

**Historical Overview: Stock Price Behavior During Past Recessions**

The analysis of stock price trends during previous recessions reveals valuable patterns.

**The Great Depression (1929-1939)**

The 1973-1975 recession, marked by stagflation and the oil crisis, resulted in a 50% decline in the S&P 500, causing a significant drop in investor sentiment and stock prices.

**The Early 1980s Recession**

The 1980-1982 economic downturn was primarily due to tight monetary policy, causing a 16% drop in the Dow Jones and reducing consumer spending and industrial production.

**The Dot-Com Bubble (2000-2002)**

The dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, leading to a significant bear market, with the NASDAQ Composite losing 78% of its value from 2000 to 2002, largely due to overvaluation of tech stocks and speculative investments.

**The Great Recession (2007-2009)**

The Great Recession, triggered by the subprime mortgage crisis and Lehman Brothers collapse, resulted in a severe global economic downturn, with the S&P 500 falling 57% between 2007 and 2009.

**COVID-19 Pandemic Recession (2020)**

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant market downturn in early 2020, with the S&P 500 dropping over 30%. However, unprecedented fiscal and monetary interventions led to a swift recovery.",analyzing market reactions economic downturns emotions significantly influence stock market fluctuations influencing investor behavior decision making emotions optimism fear shape investment strategies market trends key emotional factors 1 fear panic fear lead massive stock price declines triggered investors anticipating unfavorable economic conditions market downturns resulting panic induced asset liquidation 2 greed overconfidence economic booms greed lead inflated stock prices overconfidence market stability future growth prospects artificially increasing asset values 3 optimism pessimism positive economic news boosts market participation higher stock prices pessimistic outlooks reduce investment prices decline negative economic indicators 4 herd mentality investors herd mentality amplify market trends leading pronounced fluctuations asset prices rising intrinsic value crashing sentiment shifts read emotions affect stock prices recessions historical overview stock price behavior past recessions analysis stock price trends previous recessions reveals valuable patterns great depression 1929 1939 1973 1975 recession marked stagflation oil crisis resulted 50 decline s p 500 causing significant drop investor sentiment stock prices early 1980s recession 1980 1982 economic downturn primarily tight monetary policy causing 16 drop dow jones reducing consumer spending industrial production dot com bubble 2000 2002 dot com bubble burst early 2000s leading significant bear market nasdaq composite losing 78 value 2000 2002 largely overvaluation tech stocks speculative investments great recession 2007 2009 great recession triggered subprime mortgage crisis lehman brothers collapse resulted severe global economic downturn s p 500 falling 57 2007 2009 covid 19 pandemic recession 2020 covid 19 pandemic caused significant market downturn early 2020 s p 500 dropping 30 unprecedented fiscal monetary interventions led swift recovery,post,ValueInvesting,2024-08-23 06:39:18,1.34,,0,,2599,346,2024-08-23,6,Friday

1ez9fpd,"Analysis: Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.. I stg most of you idiots look at the same 5 stocks. Every fucking post in this entire sub is about Lulu, Nike, Mag 7, Starbucks, or Ulta. And the worst part is none of you even know what you’re talking about. Every post is “I’m thinking of buying Ulta because it’s down 50%, thoughts?” Or “I like Amazon because it grows” DON’T YOU THINK THE ENTIRE FUCKING WORLD IS THINKING THE EXACT SAME THING WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU POSSIBLY GONNA KNOW ABOUT THESE 50b OR 100b or 1T COMPANIES THAT THE REST OF THE ENTIRE WORLD DOESN’T KNOW??????

I digress. 

I typically don’t share my analysis here because I don’t want something I’m buying getting bid up. However, I’ve built my position in this company over the past couple months (it’s now close to a third of my account), so I figured I’d have nothing to lose by showing you buffoons what a real thesis looks like. Please, feel free to bid the price up at this point or comment why I’m wrong but I guarantee I’ll cook your logic. Here it is:

Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of pistols, revolvers, and rifles. The company was founded in 1852 and is listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol SWBI. Its market cap is ~$670m and it has virtually no debt.

The firearms industry is generally overlooked because of its unpredictability and politicization:
1) Firearm spending is discretionary and cyclical. This leads to lumpy returns for manufacturers and a stock that doesn't ""screen"" well. 
2) The US is divided when it comes to firearms. Polarization regarding the subject has led to an uncertain regulatory outlook and one side of the aisle dismissing the industry as evil.

1) Cyclicality should not be a deterrent in itself. The problem with most cyclical industries is the infighting and value destruction that comes with the inevitable downturns. The firearms manufacturers stay rational during downcycles for a couple of reasons. First, they rarely face inventory impairments so they're not incentivized to chase unprofitable volume. Second, many of the manufacturers utilize flexible 3p production models that allow them to rapidly adjust to shifts in demand. Finally, the industry is an oligopoly so there's more to be gained from focusing on margins than market share. Both Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger (the only public firearms manufacturers) have been profitable in every single year over the past 20 years (on a free cash flow basis, which I define as operating income plus depreciation & amortization minus capital expenditures and the impact of any one-time items). 

2) Since the turn of the century, firearm ownership has become increasingly controversial. The primary point of contention today is whether it should be legal to manufacture/sell/possess assault rifles and large-capacity magazines (~60% of S&W's business). Most investors acknowledge this uncertainty, deem it a risk, and call it a day. What's rarely considered is the fact that this uncertainty actually drives demand. Since the 2000s, the domestic non-military firearms market excluding shotguns has roughly doubled in size from ~$2b to ~$4b. It's likely that much of this growth can be attributed to consumers' perception of a possible decrease in supply going forward. Furthermore, I'm skeptical that a ban on assault weapons or large-capacity magazines would have much of a material effect effect on the size of the firearms market. This is because demand has historically exploded whenever there's an event that scares or pisses off the industry's customer base. 

Now, consider the following:

Attractive valuation:
Because the firearms business is highly cyclical, I average Smith & Wesson's results through each cycle to arrive at an average earning power. I define each cycle as beginning in the year after the market size peaks and ending on the next peak. During the last two cycles (which spanned from 2015-2022), Smith & Wesson averaged $160m in pre-tax free cash flow.

The best advice was tied to how to calculate a ""value"" stock. It is not simply this stock has a very low price compared to what it was 3-4 years ago and is a long time established company. I would have made that mistake before reading some info on this sub.

I would have bought stocks a few months ago that continue to drop hard. Looking closer at their numbers it makes sense since even though they are long term established businesses , things changed and you can not just take the name and a low price compared to 3-4 years ago as a reason to sell. You have to do the research and if you can't do the research or don't want to, then as this sub has said before, just buy an index.

1arja3n,"How many meteorologists missed the boat in the collapse of natural gas prices. Many other meteorologists have ""missed"" the boat not calling for this huge collapse in natural gas prices. I see nothing to foster a major rally. Other than a brief buy recommendation I had for WeatherWealth clients, ahead of the polar vortex 3-4 weeks ago, I have touted that El Nino and record warm global oceans brought on by climate change would NOT create consistent cold weather and would be bearish natural gas since $3.00 !!!! **The inverse natural gas ETF (KOLD) is up a whopping 100% this winter.**  
Some folks keep taking about stratospheric warming and have been wrong.  
The stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere about 6-30 miles above Earth's surface. Usually in winter, the stratosphere gets extremely cold.But sometimes a sudden ""stratospheric warming"" event happens when the stratosphere rapidly warms by up to 90°F in just a few days!  
The stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere about 6-30 miles above Earth's surface. Usually in winter, the stratosphere gets extremely cold. But sometimes a sudden ""stratospheric warming"" event happens when the stratosphere rapidly warms up to 90°F in just a few days! The top part can wobble and destabilize the whole vortex. When those vortex pieces swing down, they can funnel bitter-cold Arctic air to lower latitudes for weeks or months.  
So stratospheric warming high above us can ultimately lead to much colder winter weather and big snowstorms especially across North America and Northern Europe, thousands of miles away from the initial warming! However, NOT this February or March. El Nino and record-warm global oceans will prevent any consistent cold weather through March.

1arjyxy,"Artificial Inteligance (AI) Transforms Pattern Recognition in Stock Markets. In the intricate world of financial trading, understanding and capitalizing on market patterns stand as a pinnacle of strategy. These patterns, which are deeply rooted in the psychology of market participants, offer insights into the potential movements of financial instruments. In this context, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way traders approach market patterns. AI-driven tools, such as Pattern Search Engine (PSE), are at the forefront of this transformation.  
  
The Sophistication of Trading Patterns  
  
Trading patterns are among the most sophisticated strategies in the financial markets. They are not mere reflections of price movements but are deeply interwoven with the psychological underpinnings of market behavior. Recognizing these patterns requires a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and a keen eye for detail.  
  
AI in Trading: A Game-Changer  
  
The role of AI in trading patterns is transformative. AI systems like Tickeron’s PSE are designed to teach traders to recognize patterns, including both entry and exit points. This is achieved by leveraging the power of AI to analyze vast amounts of data, a task that is humanly impossible to accomplish with such speed and accuracy.  
  
The Power of Pattern Search Engine (PSE)  
  
PSE stands out in its ability to analyze 39 types of patterns across various assets like stocks, penny stocks, ETFs, and Forex pairs. This tool offers a comprehensive solution by allowing traders to customize settings such as confidence levels, price ranges, and asset classes. Moreover, PSE enhances user experience by providing options for setting up email or push notifications, ensuring that traders do not miss any critical trading opportunities.  
  
Ease of Use and Accessibility  
  
Using PSE is designed to be user-friendly. Traders can select various criteria such as the types of patterns, minimum confidence levels, and the assets they wish to track. The AI then takes over, performing complex tasks like finding patterns, determining breakout and target prices, and backtesting. This process culminates in the AI providing valuable statistics and potential trade impacts directly to the user's inbox.  
  
Alternative for Beginners: AI Robots  
  
For those who may not feel comfortable customizing their own settings, Tickeron offers AI Robots, like Swing Traders, which come with minimal trade requirements per day. These robots are a great way for beginners to dip their toes into the world of AI-driven trading without feeling overwhelmed by the complexities of customization.  
  
Real-Time Pattern Trading  
  
Tickeron's Real-time Patterns feed (RTP) is another remarkable tool, scanning thousands of stocks and ETFs every minute. This tool allows users to select from various time frames and patterns, with the AI providing predictions on target prices, breakout prices, and confidence levels.  
  
The integration of AI in financial trading, particularly in pattern recognition, marks a significant leap forward. Tools like Tickeron’s PSE and RTP are redefining the landscape, making sophisticated trading strategies more accessible and efficient. As the financial world continues to evolve, the synergy between AI and trading patterns will undoubtedly become a cornerstone of successful trading strategies.  
  
Sergey Savastiouk, the founder of Tickeron, captures the spirit of the modern era in pattern trading with his statement: “We’re in a new and thrilling era of pattern trading investing—we’re excited to facilitate access to this success.” The introduction of RTP and PSE marks a significant shift in the trading landscape, offering sophisticated analysis and insights to everyday investors in an unprecedented way.",artificial inteligance ai transforms pattern recognition stock markets intricate world financial trading understanding capitalizing market patterns stand pinnacle strategy patterns deeply rooted psychology market participants offer insights potential movements financial instruments context advent artificial intelligence ai revolutionizing way traders approach market patterns ai driven tools pattern search engine pse forefront transformation sophistication trading patterns trading patterns sophisticated strategies financial markets mere reflections price movements deeply interwoven psychological underpinnings market behavior recognizing patterns requires nuanced understanding market dynamics keen eye detail ai trading game changer role ai trading patterns transformative ai systems like tickeron s pse designed teach traders recognize patterns including entry exit points achieved leveraging power ai analyze vast amounts data task humanly impossible accomplish speed accuracy power pattern search engine pse pse stands ability analyze 39 types patterns assets like stocks penny stocks etfs forex pairs tool offers comprehensive solution allowing traders customize settings confidence levels price ranges asset classes pse enhances user experience providing options setting email push notifications ensuring traders miss critical trading opportunities ease use accessibility pse designed user friendly traders select criteria types patterns minimum confidence levels assets wish track ai takes performing complex tasks like finding patterns determining breakout target prices backtesting process culminates ai providing valuable statistics potential trade impacts directly user s inbox alternative beginners ai robots feel comfortable customizing settings tickeron offers ai robots like swing traders come minimal trade requirements day robots great way beginners dip toes world ai driven trading feeling overwhelmed complexities customization real time pattern trading tickeron s real time patterns feed rtp remarkable tool scanning thousands stocks etfs minute tool allows users select time frames patterns ai providing predictions target prices breakout prices confidence levels integration ai financial trading particularly pattern recognition marks significant leap forward tools like tickeron s pse rtp redefining landscape making sophisticated trading strategies accessible efficient financial world continues evolve synergy ai trading patterns undoubtedly cornerstone successful trading strategies sergey savastiouk founder tickeron captures spirit modern era pattern trading statement new thrilling era pattern trading investing excited facilitate access success introduction rtp pse marks significant shift trading landscape offering sophisticated analysis insights everyday investors unprecedented way,post,investing,2024-02-15 16:51:05,0.33,AI,1,NYSE,3852,561,2024-02-15,16,Thursday

I noticed the main challenges are:  


* **Finding out if the startup/business is real (due diligence)**: Like I don't know if their revenue is accurate or how many active users/customers they have
* **Tracking their investments**: If you've invested $25k in each startup, how can you track them? Bth the financial amount and the startup's progress
* **Exiting sooner than a liquidity event**: Is it possible to transfer your shares you got as an angel investor sooner than a liquidity event (e.g. another funding round) by the startup? Like sell your shares to another investor or exchange them for another startup lol
* **People just assume you're rich by default**: Noticed in some events when someone says I'm an angel investor, founders rush into them asking for >$100k. Is that normal?

1eb4g7d,"How to protect my investment portfolio during severely down markets?. I think there's growing suspicion of how the market is doing overall (Doing pretty well from what we're seeing). despite record job gains/added to the economy and how inflation rate is hovering close to 3% that has made the Federal Reserve hesitant on cutting/reducing interest rates -- And consumer prices on some services and goods are still relatively high. Economic experts are puzzled by these factors, and would think that sometime in ne end of 2024 that we may look to enter a recession -- Something they expected earlier this year.

My question: If we are to begin to hit recession, how do I protect my investment/retirement portfolios (e.g.. 401k. Roth IRA, and taxable income)? Obviously adding bonds and treasuries will help as they pay you interest, but how does it all work (I'll do my due diligence) for those who experienced some near crashes of the market in 1980s and 2008?

After garnering huge asset flows in 2020 and 2021 (totaling an estimated $29.2 billion), its funds were decimated in the 2022 bear market, with losses ranging from 34.1% to 67.5% for the year. Many of its funds enjoyed a strong rebound in 2023, but that wasn’t enough to offset their previous losses. As a result, the ARK family wiped out an estimated $14.3 billion in shareholder value over the 10-year period—more than twice as much as the second-worst fund family on the list. ARK Innovation alone accounts for about $7.1 billion of value destruction over the trailing 10-year period.

I’m curious as to what other investors think about my current investments and the funds I’ve chosen. Considering how nice the JP Morgan fund has currently been, would it be wise to rollover or best to stay put seeing as how this fund is not available through my current employer.

1ajs175,"How does the tax system for DRIP work?. In my money markets account I hold thousands of dollars in VYM (high dividend yield etf). I bought some time toward the end of 2023. I know that the taxes on selling after you have been holding for more than a year are less. However, I have DRIP on so I am constantly buying more VYM. 

So, for example, if I think I will want to see VYM in a year. Is it a good idea to turn of DRIP or do I pay two different tax rates depending on whether the stock was purchased by me or with the dividend?

Along those lines. If, hypothetically, I buy $10,000 VYM and dividend reinvestment gains me another $1000 and I sell $6000 does Vanguard sell the “best” (in terms of tax benefit) stock? 

Another (semi) related question. On vanguard is there a way to transfer an etf from money markets to Roth or do I have to sell, transfer to my bank account, and then transfer to my Roth?

1f2qvkp,"Visa - time to sell, or time to buy?. I contemplated adding to my Visa holdings after earnings last month, but didn't. The stock is up decently today and it caught my eye. I've done some research and I see a couple of issues that have me thinking about actually selling my holdings instead of adding.

First of all, Visa is certainly a laggard in this last bull run. 

Next, the anti-trust issues. Visa and MC make up a duopoly, undeniably. Things are not looking good for their margins, long term: [https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-visa-mastercard-30-bln-swipe-fee-settlement-2024-06-25/](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-visa-mastercard-30-bln-swipe-fee-settlement-2024-06-25/)

The article basically says that a proposed settlement to this very elongated suit was denied on June 25 by a judge for being too favorable to the CC companies. The judge says that trial is the next step. I don't like that they have to give up even more to merchants or risk trial.

Thirdly, CBDCs.

Central banks have been talking about this a lot recently, especially the ECB, and there are a lot of problems that it would potentially solve. An adoption of CBDCs, such as [project mBridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBridge), would delete Visa and MC as we know them today.

[Project mBridge reaches minimum viable product stage and invites further international participation - June 5, 2024](https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/mcbdc_bridge.htm)

I don't know if these things will affect the share price short-medium term. The problem for me is the downside risk is MASSIVE.

Visa has a tangible book value of -$2.55 per diluted share. Even if I only discount goodwill and count the other $26.243B of intangible assets, I calculate $6.55 per share. In other words, you can't even see the floor its so far away.

I realize I'm not actually making a good case for holding/buying Visa. I have searched the sub about some of these stories and I see a lot of people proposing that they are valid concerns (are bearish on Visa), but I haven't really seen many compelling arguments in the other direction.

I'm not a CFA or a prophet. Just a noob who has been avoiding a lot of nice things like vacations in favor of getting (hopefully) wealthier. My small cap portfolio has outperformed the bigger names, Visa being my largest holding of those, by about 6x since 2021.

Also, I do not own any MC. Visa and RY are my only finance stocks.

Any advice or general discussion or appreciated.

When I looked at the performance of CJ Century, I found that its share price had been trending down since peaking in mid-2022. When I looked at its ROE, I also found that it had declined from its 2014 peak.



CJ Century is focussed on its legacy logistics businesses – total logistics and procurement logistics. The EBIT margins for these 2 businesses have been declining since 2015. The Group needs to improve its operations to arrest the decline. However, it does not have a clear track record of delivering operating improvements.



To deliver a sufficient same margin of safety from the Earnings Value, CJ Century needs to achieve 11% better performance than its past 2 years average. Can it deliver this with just the legacy businesses?

1exjaha,"GCT: GigaCloud's warehouse rental expenses seem suspicious.. Hello, I am a beginner seeking guidance. I am facing challenges in accurately determining the CAPEX for GigaCloud.

The company's most significant capital expenditure is warehouse rental, which is stated in their recent quarterly report to be approximately $100 million annually. I believe this should be classified as CAPEX and deducted when calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF).

However, the Income Statement already includes rental expenses related to sales under the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) section. The report states: ""Cost of Product sales primarily consist of the purchase price of merchandise, shipping and handling costs for self-owned merchandise, warehouse rental expenses excluding the portion allocated to cost of service revenue and abnormal capacity, packaging fees and personnel related costs.""

My understanding is that this only accounts for the rental space allocated to sold goods. In that case, where are the expenses for rental space allocated to unsold goods accounted for? It doesn't make sense that only the cost of space for sold goods is recognized when the total rental cost is $100 million annually.

Is it possible that the company is concealing expenses?",gct gigacloud s warehouse rental expenses suspicious hello beginner seeking guidance facing challenges accurately determining capex gigacloud company s significant capital expenditure warehouse rental stated recent quarterly report approximately 100 million annually believe classified capex deducted calculating free cash flow fcf income statement includes rental expenses related sales cost goods sold cogs section report states cost product sales primarily consist purchase price merchandise shipping handling costs self owned merchandise warehouse rental expenses excluding portion allocated cost service revenue abnormal capacity packaging fees personnel related costs understanding accounts rental space allocated sold goods case expenses rental space allocated unsold goods accounted doesn t sense cost space sold goods recognized total rental cost 100 million annually possible company concealing expenses,post,ValueInvesting,2024-08-21 07:16:49,10.0,"FCF,GCT",2,BOTH,1245,190,2024-08-21,7,Wednesday

1exko6e,"CTRN - Citi Trends a decent retailer, risky short position, fairly valued. I personally think, this stock is over shorted. Just look at the current 13F filings(https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ctrn) . there are about 9.1m shares held by institutions and about 700k shares held by insiders of which the new Interim CEO Ken Seipel bought 573k in July 2024(Holding 4,9% of shares).

That makes 9.8m shares held by individuals or funds who have to report to the SEC.

There are 8.6m shares outstanding or about 113% of shares held thight.

The largest shareholder Fund 1 incresed his holdings from roughly 20% to 30% last quater.

1.72m shares were shorted with a 10 day average trading volume of 100k. That are 17 days for shorts to cover (basically a whole month). They can not exit wthout moving the price. So they are (F\*\*\* up).

$CTRN EV is 80, market cap 130m. They have 55m in cash and authorized buyback for 50m.

This retailer currently loses money but it will not go out of business in the near future. 

If this turnaround is successful and you put in a positive net profit margin like the hisorical average of 2%, wich will lead to 14m net profits it trades at a PE of 9.  EV/EBTDA should be around 4-7.

Momentum is negative and this stock should go down further before it gets better. Margins have to improve.

From last earnings report:

>^(""Fiscal 2024 Outlook)

>^(The Company’s updated fiscal 2024 outlook is as follows:)

>**^(Expecting full year comparable store sales growth of low to mid-single digits)**^(, a range slightly below our previous outlook)

>^(Full year gross margin to expand by approximately 75 to 100 basis points, consistent with previous outlook)

>^(SG&A dollars expected to increase by approximately 1.5% to 2.5%, slightly better than previous outlook from streamlined costs in a variety of areas)

1f2xkzy,"How do you distinguish Deep Value and Value Traps ?. The difference between a value investment and a value trap mainly lies in their future prospects and underlying fundamentals. A true value investment is a stock that is temporarily underpriced relative to its intrinsic value, with potential for future growth and profitability. It typically features a low price due to temporary factors, consistent or growing cash flow, a strong business plan, quality financial statements, and a price below intrinsic value, providing a margin of safety.

 In contrast, a value trap is a stock that appears cheap based on metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio but is actually a poor investment due to fundamental issues within the business. Warning signs of a value trap include inconsistent profits, struggles with cost management, poor management practices, high debt levels, and declining revenues.

 Ultimately, value investments have strong underlying fundamentals and identifiable catalysts for growth, while value traps face long-term challenges and lack clear paths to improvement. To avoid falling into value traps, investors should conduct thorough fundamental analyses, compare companies to their sector peers, and critically evaluate management's plans and execution, looking beyond simple valuation metrics to assess long-term viability and growth potential.

 However its easy to dismiss many good value investments as value traps.    For example even companies like Microsoft and Walmart at times were dismissed as value traps when for many years the stock price was flat.  Recently I had invested in H&R Block was dismissed as a Value Trap but it turned out to be a great investment.  All have proved to multi-baggers.

 Ultimately you cannot just look at numbers alone and say - this is a value trap.  You have to identify a solid qualitative issue, i.e. if it in a secularly challenged industry such as a department store or a brick & mortar pharmacy.  There is a plausible case to be made that companies like Macy's and Kohls may be value traps due to competition from e-commerce.  Or companies like Walgreen Boots Alliance and CVS due to pressure from Pharmacy Benefit Managers.  Others may be tobacco companies such as Altria and BTI given government policy against tobacco.  Other value traps may be the oil and gas infrastructure if panic develops over climate change and global warming and governments get serious on the issue.  This will leave many companies stranded.

1f2xnx0,"“Value” Investing. There seems to be a lot of confusion about what value means. This should be obvious, but if the market is trading at largely overvalued multiples, you’ll have a hard time finding “value” plays. They still exist, but they’ll be largely unknown companies you’ve never heard of.  Mag7 stocks can be value, but most analysts would agree they aren’t at these prices. However, if the price crashes and or future growth expectations increase, there could be value.

Value is just getting more for your money. It’s buying things that will pay themselves back in shorter time than other investments. Treasury bills are close to 5%, so if you find a stock that’s p/e is low and has high expected growth - you’ve found value. 

A lot of people say that’s a growth stock. Yeah, you can be growth and value. That’s pretty obvious. You can also just be a value stock if earnings are paying you back more than 5-10% per year.

I think many of you have not been in the market long enough to understand that there will be crashes and there will be opportunities to buy things cheap, so if you can’t find value now, maybe just be patient.

1f2zbyi,"Unveiling Powermatic: A Hidden Gem with High Margins and Real Estate Upside. **Powermatic Data Systems Limited (Ticker: BCY)**

Powermatic Data Systems presents a fascinating opportunity: a profitable, cash-rich business trading at a valuation close to its adjusted asset value. How can such an undervalued situation exist? This is precisely why I challenge the efficient market theory and resonate more with Warren Buffett's view that markets are often driven by irrational emotions rather than logic.

Buffett’s analogy of ""Mr. Market"" perfectly encapsulates this phenomenon: ""Mr. Market is your partner in investing. He is a man with incurable emotional problems. On some days, he is euphoric and sees only favourable factors affecting his business. On other days, he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead. If you are a prudent investor, you will want to buy from Mr. Market when he is depressed and sell to him when he is euphoric.""

# Business Snapshot

Powermatic, based in Singapore, specialises in wireless connectivity products. As stated in their 2024 annual report, “Our portfolio of high-quality wireless products, from modules to embedded boards and antennas, is designed to elevate connectivity, optimize efficiency, and enhance productivity.” These components are essential in enabling real-time communication between machines, allowing data to be managed effectively across various industries, from healthcare to industrial IoT.

Between FY2019 and FY2024, Powermatic achieved a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% in revenue and 9% in profit before tax (excluding a one-time charge of $5.8 million in FY2024). This steady growth is further reinforced by their recent launch of Wi-Fi 7 Dual-Band Dual-Concurrent Modules, which promises enhanced wireless performance and power efficiency.

# Moats: Competitive Advantages

1. **Exclusive Qualcomm Partnership:** Powermatic, through its subsidiary Compex, is one of only 10 Qualcomm Authorized Design Centers (ADC) globally and the only one in Southeast Asia. This exclusive relationship allows Powermatic to design advanced wireless connectivity solutions, providing it with a significant technological edge and industry credibility.
2. **High-Margin, Niche Market:** Powermatic focuses on high-performance, specialized markets such as industrial IoT, healthcare, and security. This focus on niche, high-margin sectors helps it avoid the intense price competition seen in more commoditized segments of the wireless market.
3. **Strong Financial Position:** With no debt and substantial cash reserves, Powermatic is well-positioned to invest heavily in R&D, pursue strategic acquisitions, and withstand market downturns, giving it a solid financial advantage over more leveraged competitors.
4. **Intellectual Property and Expertise:** Over the years, Powermatic has developed significant expertise in wireless connectivity technologies, coupled with proprietary technology and design capabilities. This expertise acts as a barrier to entry for new competitors.
5. **Customer Relationships and Reputation:** As a trusted supplier with a long-standing presence in the wireless connectivity market, Powermatic enjoys strong relationships with its customers. These relationships are difficult for new entrants to disrupt, especially in industries where reliability and long-term partnerships are crucial.

While Powermatic may not have the widest moat, its strategic partnerships and niche focus give it a solid competitive edge. Given these factors, a valuation of around 10x adjusted P/E seems reasonable. Excluding the one-time charge, FY2024 profit before tax would have been S$12.1 million, representing a 4% improvement over FY2023. However, digging deeper reveals an asset almost equal to the company’s market cap.

# The Real Estate Angle

The real kicker lies in Powermatic’s real estate holdings. In 2009, they acquired a property at 7 Harrison Rd for around $19 million—an investment that has appreciated significantly.

1arkuv9,"Blackrock Vs Vanguard investment funds. Who owns the underlying companies.. I just learned this myself, a bit embarrassingly late, that vanguard is owned by it's investors. So in that case, if I invested in a vanguard fund, then I should also be the partial owner in the company in relation to my percentage ownership of the fund? Eg, if the fund owns 100 shares of apple, and I own 1 percent of the fund, then I own 1 share of apple. Of course in reality the ownership stake would be negligible. 

Is this actually true? And do we not get voting rights in each underlying company due to just how many there are and how insane it would be to tally every single investors vote for every single company, in say the SP500. Or is it because we only own a partial stake in vanguard and it means nothing for the underlying companies they invest in? If someone had a larger, majority stake in a vanguard fund, would they have voting rights, or am I missing something?

1aqlm34,"Exploring a Potential SPA Center/Hotel Project in Partnership with Local Government. Hi everyone,  
I'm reaching out to this community because of a unique opportunity that has caught my attention. A local government here in Estonia is looking for partners to develop a SPA center/hotel, and this announcement really speaks to me both professionally and personally.  
**A Bit About Me:**  
My current business involves supplying promotional goods and items like hotel slippers to various clients, including those in the hospitality industry. This has given me a unique insight into this sector, albeit from a different angle. On top of that, I am a huge SPA fan myself. I've always been drawn to the relaxation, wellness, and the sheer joy that SPA experiences offer.  
**The Opportunity:**  
When I learned about the local government's initiative, it immediately sparked my interest. The idea of being part of creating a new SPA center/hotel — a place where people can find peace, wellness, and relaxation — is incredibly appealing. I see it as a chance to blend my professional background with my personal passion for SPAs.  


**What I'm Hoping to Find Out:**  
Interest and Viability: Does the idea of developing a SPA center/hotel resonate with you? Do you think there's a market for another one, considering the unique angle we could bring?  
Advice on Getting Started: For those who have experience in launching or running a SPA or hotel, what were your initial steps? I'm looking for guidance on how to begin this journey.  
**Building a Team:** Regarding team assembly, I have already started to consider involving locals who have a proven track record of successfully establishing SPA hotels. The idea is to tap into the wealth of experience right here in our community, leveraging their insights and expertise to ensure the success of this new venture.  
**Funding and Investment:** One of the most crucial aspects – I don't currently have the funding to bring this project to life on my own. How do you approach finding and securing funding for such an endeavor? Are there investors out there who might be interested in a wellness-focused project like this? I'm keen to explore all avenues for outside investment, whether it's through traditional financing, venture capital, or crowdfunding.  
**Your Thoughts and Suggestions:** I'm open to any insights, suggestions, or advice you might have. Whether it's about potential challenges, funding strategies, or tips for success, I'm all ears.

1arlgfo,"Why this winter has once again been warm resulting in a spiral down of natural gas prices. Many other meteorologists have ""missed"" the boat not calling for this huge collapse in natural gas prices. I see nothing to foster a major rally.  I have touted that El Nino and record warm global oceans brought on by climate change would NOT create consistent cold weather and would be bearish natural gas since $3.00 !!!! The inverse natural gas ETF (KOLD) is up around 100% this winter.

Another reason for the major bearish reaction in natural gas prices is a lack of LNG exports to Europe. European supplies are plentiful in the midst of yet another warm winter and an overreaction to the Russian-Ukraine war a year ago.  
Some folks keep talking about stratospheric warming and have been wrong.  
The stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere about 6-30 miles above Earth's surface. Usually in winter, the stratosphere gets extremely cold. But sometimes a sudden ""stratospheric warming"" event happens when the stratosphere rapidly warms up to 90°F in just a few days!  
The stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere about 6-30 miles above Earth's surface. Usually in winter, the stratosphere gets extremely cold. But sometimes a sudden ""stratospheric warming"" event happens when the stratosphere rapidly warms up to 90°F in just a few days! The top part can wobble and destabilize the whole vortex. When those vortex pieces swing down, they can funnel bitter-cold Arctic air to lower latitudes for weeks or months.  
So stratospheric warming high above us can ultimately lead to much colder winter weather and big snowstorms especially across North America and Northern Europe, thousands of miles away from the initial warming! **However, NOT this February or March. El Nino and record-warm global oceans will prevent any consistent cold weather through March.**

1edj7ph,"Highest reasonable withdrawal rate for a 30 year retirement?. I know stuff like the 4% rule and such so those are reasonably safe positions to take.

I'm considering going as high as 5% if my health declines faster than expected. Its an awkward spot where I *probably* won't get disability since its partially mental health (I've been in the higher security mental hospital ward for a month+ before with the kind of eye watering bills one might expect with that) which is hard to quantify.

That said it does affect my work performance and while one of my doctors suggests trying to apply for disability anyway I don't see a point as long as I can keep employment that keeps me from touching my savings.

But eventually, it will reach a critical point where age bias (tech) combined with just the fact my health affects job performance to the points it can't really be concealed, I just started with a high enough baseline performance I can stay employed for awhile.

The odds for stuff like firecalc is stuff like:

For our purposes, failure means the portfolio was depleted before the end of the 30 years. FIRECalc found that 41 cycles failed, for a success rate of 66.9%.

For 5%. That seems kinda rough but at the same time I believe it doesn't factor in social security so it might be a realistic goal of 5% (ignoring social security)

Just polling people's thoughts on the subject (source material for research welcome) to try to gauge how aggressive my portfolio needs to be given my doctors and I have a rough timeline of how fast things will decline because I can't keep taking the drugs that actually work given the side effects get worse the longer I take them.",highest reasonable withdrawal rate 30 year retirement know stuff like 4 rule reasonably safe positions m considering going high 5 health declines faster expected awkward spot probably won t disability partially mental health ve higher security mental hospital ward month kind eye watering bills expect hard quantify said affect work performance doctors suggests trying apply disability don t point long employment keeps touching savings eventually reach critical point age bias tech combined fact health affects job performance points t concealed started high baseline performance stay employed awhile odds stuff like firecalc stuff like purposes failure means portfolio depleted end 30 years firecalc found 41 cycles failed success rate 66 9 5 kinda rough time believe doesn t factor social security realistic goal 5 ignoring social security polling people s thoughts subject source material research welcome try gauge aggressive portfolio needs given doctors rough timeline fast things decline t taking drugs actually work given effects worse longer,post,investing,2024-07-27 15:39:25,13.4,,0,,1672,297,2024-07-27,15,Saturday

&#x200B;

This 10% correction will set the stage for a massive economic situation to play out. The Federal Reserve will not want to abandon the inflation threat, so they are going to be aggressive at keeping interest rates high while doing nothing to control the National Debt.

High interest rates will actually cause the Federal Reserve to have to increase the national debt, which in turn will cause inflation to come back over the Spring and Summer 2024 months.

May FOMC - no rate cuts. Market will trade flat through the summer months. Economic situation with layoffs and job cuts will get worse. Banks will start to experience stress as they will be upside down in ""Bond gambling"" at a much faster rate than March 2023.

&#x200B;

September FOMC - Federal Reserve may have to institute emergency rate cuts, even with inflation running hot at 5% once again. This will cause a massive stock market crash, and being in September - right at the seasonal low for stock markets in general. S&P 500 could correct to 2,900 by January 2025.

&#x200B;

And the scary part - inflation may end up at 6% going into 2025 even if we have a major market crash, because the interest rate hikes do not address the cause of inflation.

So…..A few weeks ago I bought in to Nvda @ 600 a share and got a pretty good roasting for doing so. The single best piece of advice I took from said roasting, is- if you are going to invest in a stock ( Nvidia) , at least take the time to research what a semiconductor is and all that surrounds it. I did just that and now have shares in Nvidia, TSM and SMH. Call me what you will but I believe I’ll see some good profits moving forward. All that said- my future allocations towards tech will go to TSM and SMH. Nvidia is going to have to either take a dip or split before I add to its individual stock. 
I do recognize the risk, overlap and lack of diversification. I also recognize the potential for big profits surrounding AI and that’s what I’m after over the next 10 yrs. 
I also note that I have plenty of safe money invested in other ETF’s, a 457, pension and rental properties.

The company is based in China—I’m a believer that the situation there is a generational opportunity, and that any investor should own some exposure to Chinese stocks given with how incredibly cheap they are.

YRD is my China exposure. The company earned $292M in 2023 and grew EPS +16% Y/Y in Q1 2024. Net cash (cash minus total liabilities) is $487M, the current market cap is $421M, and they’ve been profitable every year of their existence besides Covid. 

The business is very easy to understand; they provide consumer credit underwriting, loan acquisition, and other services to banks, insurance companies, and loan companies. In many ways these loans provide consumers with access to everyday credit in the same way credit cards do for Americans. The credit card business isn't as substantial given the limit on interchange fee, which is why these solutions exist. It's a growing industry and the largest player is a private company spun-off of Ant Group, the largest public competitor is Qifu ($QFIN). 

There's been substantial regulation limiting the ability of new players to enter the space since 2019, and the engrained relationship with funding partners creates a stickiness and cost of switching.

This sounds cool on paper but also sounds too easy and that anyone could do something like this, so my point with this post is to ask your opinion about this, if this can work long term or if it gives any edge at all? Do you this working? If not what are the reasons?

Fundamental data would be pulled from a paid API.

1expfoa,"I’m 13, rate my portfolio. Hello, I am 13, and I am investing in stocks. I started investing in December 2022, and since then I have learned and made much progress. I saved all the money I got since I was a child, and when I learned about investing I slowly invested almost all of it. My return now is around 100€, my portfolio value is about 930€, and I'm up around 12%. It isn't much but that's because I have deposited most of the money this year. Some stocks I bought 2 years ago are up 50%+ but I only put like 5-10€ in each of them.

I made the mistake of diversifying too much with little money, and I now have 26 holdings. I would rather use Warren Buffett's approach of going all in on big opportunities than some smaller ones. Many people might tell me to invest in the S&P 500 ETF, but I pick specific stocks to learn, learning in this scenario is worth more than the potential financial upside.

Here is my current portfolio, what are your opinions?

NOTE: ""First Buy"" means I bought it at the start when I bought random stocks I liked, mainly big companies

**Bank Of America (BAC) - 12.7% - +9.7%**  
- My first big buy, and my biggest position. I saw Buffett bought it and I looked into it - it seemed like a good buy.

**Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Corporation (SMFG) - 8.5% - +18.3%**  
- I bought during the ""2-day recession"" on 6. and 7. August and it paid off.

**Starbucks (SBUX) - 8.4% - +16.2%**  
- In my opinion, it was undervalued, and the new CEO will help the company so I am not selling.

**Visa (V) - 6.3% - +6.6%**  
- First buy + bought most of it 3 weeks ago as a ""safe buy"" with not much but steady returns.

**Xtrackers Nikkei 225 ETF (XDJP) - 6.2% - +11%**  
- My only ETF, same as SMFG

**Erste Group (EBO) - 5.8% - +16%**  
- I live in Europe, and I liked this bank at the price I bought it at.

**Microsoft (MSFT) - 5.7% - +11.8%**  
- First Buy + added most of it during the ""2-day recession""

**UnitedHealth (UNH) - 5.6% - +19.1%**  
- Same as Visa but I bought it earlier

**Coca-Cola (KO) - 5.3% - +14.7%**  
- Same as UNH

**Walt Disney (DIS) - 4.9% - -15%**  
- My biggest loss I currently hold, but I think they have a solid future so I won't sell

**John Deere (DE) - 4.9% - +1.7%**  
- I think it's a solid company with solid growth, I am not expecting crazy returns

**Raiffeisen Bank (RAW) - 4.7% - -6.4%**  
- This wasn't a good buy, but I think it can get back in black - then I will sell

**Broadcom (AVGO) - 4.4% - +93.6%**  
- I would consider this my best investment, I would sell but Nancy Pelosi holds calls expiring Jan 2025 so I will probably sell then

**Hershey (HSY) - 3.2% -  +7.28%**  
- It was a bit undervalued, nothing crazy so I bought a little

**Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - 2.9% - +28.5%**  
- Nancy Pelosi must be a magician

**Occidental Petroleum - (OXY) - 2.1% - -2.2%**  
- Bought it because Buffett did, I planned on adding more but I never did and now I am glad

**Other Positions - Smaller than 1.5%**  
- Most of them are First Buys  
- ADS, BRK.B, GOOGL, CVX, AAPL, JPM, AXP, ORCL, BLK, XOM

I missed some big opportunities I looked at 2 years ago I found using a screener because I was scared, like CROX and QCOM, and some smaller ones like ZIM and CALM.

Right now I am considering these companies I found with the same screener: H&R Block, Sirius XM, International Money Express, International Seaways, T. Rowe and Match Group

Can you tell me what you think about my portfolio, the companies I am considering and some advice for the future? Thank you in advance!

1fsj2s5,"Building a Position in Decentralized Energy. At the risk of stating the obvious, the U.S. energy scene is in dire need of major changes due to aging infrastructure, climate change, and inefficiency. Decentralized energy resources and microgrids, in my opinion, are the solution for creating a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy grid. Several catalysts are converging to accelerate their development and deployment.

# 1. The Need for Grid Resilience

The U.S. electric grid is increasingly fragile, with power outages becoming more frequent and costly. This is due to several factors:

* **Aging Infrastructure:** Many parts of the grid are decades old, some dating back to the early 20th century, making them prone to failures, especially during extreme weather.
* **Climate Change:** More frequent and intense weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and ice storms are damaging power lines and other grid components, causing prolonged outages.
* **Growing Reliance on Renewables:** The shift to cleaner energy sources like solar and wind is beneficial for the environment but complicates grid stability due to their intermittent nature and the difficulty in ensuring load balance.

The impact of these issues is significant:

* **Economic Losses:** Power outages cost the U.S. economy around $150 billion annually.
* **Climate Change**: Between 2016 and 2020, electrical power networks caused 19% of the wildfires that occurred in those five years. While the exact costs are unavailable, they are reasonably estimated to be in the billions.
* **Inefficiency:** The centralized grid is extremely inefficient, with around two-thirds of energy lost from generation to delivery.
* **Increasing Outages:** Power outages have increased by 64% from 2011 to 2021.

# 2. The Battery Storage Boom

The rapid growth of grid-scale battery storage systems (BESS) is a game-changer for microgrids and decentralized energy. Batteries enable microgrids and home grids to operate independently for longer periods, even when renewable sources aren't available, ensuring grid resilience. In Q1 2024, U.S. energy storage capacity installations surged 84% year-over-year, hitting a record 3,851 MW.

Projections indicate significant market growth:

* **Growth Projection**: Bain projects that the grid-scale storage market could expand from around $15 billion in 2023 to between $200 billion and $700 billion by 2030, potentially reaching $1 trillion to $3 trillion by 2040.
* **Decline in Price:** The decline in lithium battery prices is driving their adoption for grid storage. The average price of stationary lithium batteries per kilowatt-hour fell by about 40% between 2019 and 2023.
* **Segmentation**: The market is segmented into three main areas: front-of-the-meter utility-scale installations, behind-the-meter commercial and industrial installations, and BTM residential installations.

These systems will turbocharge the capacity additions of wind and solar:

* **Solar and Wind:** Nearly 1 terawatt of new solar and wind capacity will be added to the U.S. power grid between 2024 and 2035.
* **Storage**: 221 gigawatts of battery storage are expected to be deployed in the same period.
* **Growth**: These additions will drive an 80% increase in the nameplate power generation capacity of the U.S. by 2035, even accounting for planned power plant retirements.

# 3. The Rise of Small, Efficient AI

As an AI Engineer, I've observed the rise of Small Language Models (SLMs). These models are equally competent when prompted and fine-tuned correctly, require significantly lower energy consumption, and are much more cost-effective. Training and running Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources and energy, which is costly and unsustainable.

For instance, training a small language model with 7 billion parameters using 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs takes about 336 hours and consumes approximately 50 MWh of energy. In contrast, a model with over 100 billion parameters requires 1024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 1344",building position decentralized energy risk stating obvious u s energy scene dire need major changes aging infrastructure climate change inefficiency decentralized energy resources microgrids opinion solution creating resilient efficient sustainable energy grid catalysts converging accelerate development deployment 1 need grid resilience u s electric grid increasingly fragile power outages frequent costly factors aging infrastructure parts grid decades old dating early 20th century making prone failures especially extreme weather climate change frequent intense weather events like hurricanes wildfires ice storms damaging power lines grid components causing prolonged outages growing reliance renewables shift cleaner energy sources like solar wind beneficial environment complicates grid stability intermittent nature difficulty ensuring load balance impact issues significant economic losses power outages cost u s economy 150 billion annually climate change 2016 2020 electrical power networks caused 19 wildfires occurred years exact costs unavailable reasonably estimated billions inefficiency centralized grid extremely inefficient thirds energy lost generation delivery increasing outages power outages increased 64 2011 2021 2 battery storage boom rapid growth grid scale battery storage systems bess game changer microgrids decentralized energy batteries enable microgrids home grids operate independently longer periods renewable sources aren t available ensuring grid resilience q1 2024 u s energy storage capacity installations surged 84 year year hitting record 3 851 mw projections indicate significant market growth growth projection bain projects grid scale storage market expand 15 billion 2023 200 billion 700 billion 2030 potentially reaching 1 trillion 3 trillion 2040 decline price decline lithium battery prices driving adoption grid storage average price stationary lithium batteries kilowatt hour fell 40 2019 2023 segmentation market segmented main areas meter utility scale installations meter commercial industrial installations btm residential installations systems turbocharge capacity additions wind solar solar wind nearly 1 terawatt new solar wind capacity added u s power grid 2024 2035 storage 221 gigawatts battery storage expected deployed period growth additions drive 80 increase nameplate power generation capacity u s 2035 accounting planned power plant retirements 3 rise small efficient ai ai engineer ve observed rise small language models slms models equally competent prompted fine tuned correctly require significantly lower energy consumption cost effective training running large language models llms require substantial computational resources energy costly unsustainable instance training small language model 7 billion parameters 8 nvidia v100 gpus takes 336 hours consumes approximately 50 mwh energy contrast model 100 billion parameters requires 1024 nvidia a100 gpus 1344,post,ValueInvesting,2024-09-30 00:33:24,2.0,"AI,BTM",2,BOTH,4043,606,2024-09-30,0,Monday

1fw95bm,"Thoughts on ACLS? Looks undervalued to me.. Hey guys, I calculate (conservative scenario) about 22% upside for ACLS. This company has good roic, good bvps growth, and also good eps, revenue and fcf growth (except fcf growth went down in the last two quarters). Have 43M long term debt while having 152M in FCF. Overall looks great. If I assume 15% growth for the next five years, with future pe of 15 -- I calculate value to be 122$ a share. And this is conservative, because if I look at the past growths gor these metrics it's more around 20s. So I feel like there is at lease 20% upside in this company. if it grows say 18 then we are looking at 40% upside.   
They make parts that are needed in semiconductors and EVs, but I've read that their main demand is coming from EVs. I think maybe they are not trading at their value because of EV demand currently. Do you have any thesis as to why it might not be trading at its value? Curios to hear your thoughts.

Even though I invested in 2022 and in 2023, I was expecting to get the first returns in November 2023 (since contracts were from 2021). On November 2023, I received the proposal for Veneer Sheets and I invested again, since I was greedy and also because I was feeling that I had no choice to proceed only with the Biomass. I was told that Veneer sheet was going to be paid on February 2024 and Biomass extraction on April/May 2024. My account manager is Patrick Murphy for the Biomass Extraction but someone with name Collin is responsible for the Veneer Sheet production. 

Close to year end of 2023, I got a message that my Veneer Sheet was scheduled and that I should provide bank details in order to send me the returns for the Veneer Sheets at the beginning of February 2024, which I provided. Yesterday and today I was trying to contact them but the emails are not delivered. I am sending emails to all the available emails on their site but no one seems to answer and also seem that are not delivered. 

I have never received any email, mentioning for any delays for the Veneer Sheet production. 

I will try to contact the Finland embassy in my country Cyprus and ask if they can help with it.

Thanks everyone for giving so many information, since until I find this group I was feeling that I was alone on this. Thank you, to the persons that provided information of the finish authorities also.

Hope we will find a solution on this.",serge energy investment situation news scam hello went comments serge energy situation admit page unfortunately lot research fine past scam feeling stupid cut long story short invested 2022 2023 expecting returns november 2023 contracts 2021 november 2023 received proposal veneer sheets invested greedy feeling choice proceed biomass told veneer sheet going paid february 2024 biomass extraction april 2024 account manager patrick murphy biomass extraction collin responsible veneer sheet production close year end 2023 got message veneer sheet scheduled provide bank details order send returns veneer sheets beginning february 2024 provided yesterday today trying contact emails delivered sending emails available emails site answer delivered received email mentioning delays veneer sheet production try contact finland embassy country cyprus ask help thanks giving information find group feeling thank persons provided information finish authorities hope find solution,post,investing,2024-02-13 14:00:57,0.6,,0,,1818,335,2024-02-13,14,Tuesday

1apuab5,"Qualified dividends for US funds. Hi all,

I would like to invest in certain funds/ETFs that pay dividends, most of them to be qualified dividends. Before doing that, I would like to see the history of the distributions from that fund.

In Vanguard, for example, I can see the year-end QDI figures (payments in December) but not the payments made in other quarters.

One example of this is payments on 09/28/2023, 06/29/2023, and 03/24/2023 from VFIAX 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares. I cannot see any option to see the qualified dividend ratio for these dividend payments.

1aqpghf,"Bitcoin - a Little Lecture on Value. In the general population and especially among Bitcoin supporters, there's a belief that the value of an item is what the last market participant traded for it. So, if ten years ago one traded 0.001 dollars for 1 bitcoin, that was bitcoin's value. Today, people trade 50,000 dollars for one bitcoin, so this is its value. 

The first question to ask here is why is the value of bitcoin expressed in dollars? For example, if we say that two bananas are more valuable than one banana we don't need dollars or anything else to express this. This is obvious in itself - two bananas give more nutrition than one.

The above is also true for stocks or fiat currencies. A hundred shares in a company's stock give more dividends, buyback value or funds from liquidated assets than one share. A thousand dollars gives more ability to satisfy debt owed to banks than a hundred dollars. Namely, new units of fiat currencies are issued as debt owed to banks. Individuals and companies owe it to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe it to central banks based on bonds.

So if we say that the higher number of bananas, shares or dollars is worth more than their lower number, we don't express this in terms of euros, pizzas, haircuts or any other item traded on the market. Rather, we are expressing this value in term of bananas, stocks, or dollars themselves.

But now let's assume that Alice has 1 bitcoin while Bob has 100 bitcoins. How can Bob prove that his holdings have a hundred times more value? If he says this is because he can get a hundred times more dollars, pizzas or haircuts on the market, he is expressing the value of bitcoins in terms of other items traded on the market. He is essentially saying what buyers are willing to trade for bitcoins. But obviously, this tells us nothing about the bitcoins themselves.

So the crucial question to ask is this: what can 100 bitcoins give that is a hundred times more in comparison to what 1 bitcoin can give?

Is that nutrition? No, bitcoins cannot be eaten. Is that dividend, buyback value, or funds from a liquidated company? No, the issuer of bitcoin pays no dividends or buybacks nor is there a company that can be liquidated. Is that debt satisfaction? No, new Bitcoin units are not issued as debt owed to someone. Is that beauty? No, bitcoin is not art. As we can see, there's nothing that bitcoins can give. Both 100 bitcoins and 1 bitcoin are equally worthless.

So basically, what the author of Bitcoin did is create a protocol that tells people: you have 1 bitcoin, you have 5 bitcoins, you have 0.001 bitcoins, etc. But these people have nothing besides what the protocol told them. If we for example write down: 'Bob owns 10 bananas' that doesn't mean it is true. If Bob cannot show an actual fruit in the said quantity, this is just a false statement. Likewise, given that Bitcoin holders can show nothing in the quantity of numbers attributed to them by the Bitcoin protocol, their holdings are essentially false statements.

To conclude. What people confuse when they say that bitcoin has value is price and value. Bitcoin has a price because buyers pay money such as dollars when the Bitcoin protocol attributes numbers to their addresses. But Bitcoin has no value because these buyers have nothing besides these numbers. That means that buying bitcoins just means buying false numeric statements issued by the Bitcoin protocol. It's some kind of a financial scheme similar to pyramid ones. As long as there are new investors, the old ones can get their investments back. But given there's no value in the scheme, the lack of new investors means the collapse of the scheme.",bitcoin little lecture value general population especially bitcoin supporters s belief value item market participant traded years ago traded 0 001 dollars 1 bitcoin bitcoin s value today people trade 50 000 dollars bitcoin value question ask value bitcoin expressed dollars example bananas valuable banana don t need dollars express obvious bananas nutrition true stocks fiat currencies shares company s stock dividends buyback value funds liquidated assets share thousand dollars gives ability satisfy debt owed banks dollars new units fiat currencies issued debt owed banks individuals companies owe commercial banks based loans governments owe central banks based bonds higher number bananas shares dollars worth lower number don t express terms euros pizzas haircuts item traded market expressing value term bananas stocks dollars let s assume alice 1 bitcoin bob 100 bitcoins bob prove holdings times value says times dollars pizzas haircuts market expressing value bitcoins terms items traded market essentially saying buyers willing trade bitcoins obviously tells bitcoins crucial question ask 100 bitcoins times comparison 1 bitcoin nutrition bitcoins eaten dividend buyback value funds liquidated company issuer bitcoin pays dividends buybacks company liquidated debt satisfaction new bitcoin units issued debt owed beauty bitcoin art s bitcoins 100 bitcoins 1 bitcoin equally worthless basically author bitcoin create protocol tells people 1 bitcoin 5 bitcoins 0 001 bitcoins etc people protocol told example write bob owns 10 bananas doesn t mean true bob actual fruit said quantity false statement likewise given bitcoin holders quantity numbers attributed bitcoin protocol holdings essentially false statements conclude people confuse bitcoin value price value bitcoin price buyers pay money dollars bitcoin protocol attributes numbers addresses bitcoin value buyers numbers means buying bitcoins means buying false numeric statements issued bitcoin protocol s kind financial scheme similar pyramid ones long new investors old ones investments given s value scheme lack new investors means collapse scheme,post,investing,2024-02-14 15:24:58,0.24,,0,,3693,649,2024-02-14,15,Wednesday

1edm3f4,"Big Returns With Verifiable Track Record But Need Advice. Hi all, I posted this on another sub as well but hoping, given the larger audience here, there's someone that might have some advice.

I'm middle-aged and have been an avid trader for a very long time. I've always wanted to manage money but within the last 5-years my career has put me in a position that I feel has helped me mature to the point where I can be consistently successful.

Recognizing I was ""ready"" I decided to start formalizing a track record a bit more than a year ago. I opened a corporate account with IBKR and funded it with $140k of my own capital.

My returns have been extremely strong, yet volatile. In 2023 I returned 157% (July through December) and this year I'm currently at about a 40% return. My strategy is discretionary, repeatable, and scales.

I also have a lot of relationships with investors, but they are in the real estate world. I put together my tear sheet and short marketing deck and have started circulating it to some folks I'm closer with to gain feedback (and potentially soft commitments).

I've also had a couple conversations with the folks at Repool about fund setup and administration.

Here's where I'm struggling... fundraising!

Yes, it's early and I've only just started talking with folks but the reception has not been strong. Mostly, I believe I'm talking with the wrong folks. These are real estate people that generally don't trust the stock market. They are also smaller mom and pop type investors.

I know I will need at least $2MM - $3MM in commitments to justify spinning up the fund and I'm recognizing it will likely be a GRIND getting there.

So I'm asking myself whether it makes sense to pursue that route or, perhaps, go the non-professional advisor route with IBKR. The logic here would be that I could take my time onboarding people individually. Then, once we get too big for that, or the fund size justifies it, I could transition to a full-fledged fund.

The other route is just grinding soft commitments to get me to the $2MM - $3MM point and hoping most are still wanting to commit when it comes time.

Any thoughts or advice from folks that have been there and done this would be much appreciated.

1ef2n1m,"What am I missing on this scenario?. Note: I tried using the search, and did find some people asking about 0% APR cards, which I guess is a bit of a similar thing, but given the limited time 0% APR lasts, compounding interests wouldn't really matter, also most answers telling them their math makes no sense is based on them having to find a way to spend/save the amount quickly enough for it to matter or that cash advances usually carry other/daily interests, which is not the case I'm presenting.

I was looking at my CC statement today, and I got curious about a detail I usually pay no attention to the ""minimum payment calculation"", usually I just pay the balance in full, but I guess I was kinda bored and tried to run some numbers.

Statement claims:

* Current balance: 7,120.88
* Minimum payment: 200.00
* APR: 21.24%

Then it says: If you make no additional transactions using this Account and each month you pay only the Minimum Payment. You will pay off the balance shown on this statement in about 21 Years. And you will end up paying an estimated total of $18,308.00

Let's say I take this 7,120.88 which I already have, and instead of paying my CC like I normally do, I put it on a 10% return investment for the same 21 years, compound interest would turn this into 52,696.29

Even if I consider that the current 10% is probably not going to stay for the entire 21 years, and use 5% which is more in line with the historic returns of this investment, after 21 years of compound interest I would have 19,838.51

Old Company:

  
• XYZ provides a 60% matching contribution of your pretax contributions, up to the first 20% of your contributions per pay

Vesting is 100% after 6 years

&#x200B;

New Company:

When you make contributions to the 401(k) plan, you are eligible to receive a company match of 100% ($1 for $1) up to the first 6% of your eligible pay.

Vesting is 100% immediately.

&#x200B;

Given a salary of $240,000...  New company will match a max of $553 per paycheck (we're paid every two weeks)?  

I'm contributing 10% of my salary towards my 401(k) right now, which coincidentally gives me the same company match as the new company.  But... if I were to increase that even by 1%, the old company would increase its match.

&#x200B;

Yeah, I get to the max contribution with less personal investment with this new company, but the old company has the potential to match up to $28,800/yr (yes, I know that's above the limit) whereas the new company can only match up to half that.

Today, it’s approaching $200, and I’m still a buyer. My thesis has not changed. Demand shocks will continue to push prices higher, even as more production capacity comes online. The most advanced chips simply cannot be made fast enough to keep up with a world that wants server-side and client-side AI training and inference on every application and device. 

Chips that aren’t optimized for AI all have to be turned over for, or at least supplemented with, chips that are. 

AI is as big as the internet, maybe even bigger. People pay upwards of $100 a month for broadband internet, and eventually, they will pay the same for AI because it will deliver so much value.

Sister in law is asking on Facebook for investing advice, and so far the answers she's got are: 

""Edward Jones and credit union advisors typically help for free until you invest in their services""

And

""Pay a financial advisor for a consultation. You don’t want a fee based advisor because even if the fee is a low percentage- they are taking a percentage of everything you earn instead of a one time fee. It really adds up over time. Just invest in some index funds and let it be!""

Is there an ETF or something that generally anyone would recommend she just put money in every pay, like a ""set it and forget it"" kinda thing to make it easy as possible?

She's mid 40's and I assume can't dump a lot of money in, but obviously has some time till she retires.

1ai1euf,"Is Life Insurance a waste of money if you're debt free?. Here's the situation - I have a $150 annual premium $25k death benefit $3.5k cash value life insurance policy (as of now.) It's generating about $72 of dividend income per my latest 1099-DIV that I received from it. 

&#x200B;

We have no mortgage, no car loans, we're DINKs, and only just opened a outstanding loan for replacing some of our windows and french doors in the house. 38 years old, wife is 39.

&#x200B;

I'm questioning right now if having this insurance does anything at all - as honestly when I pass away my 401K has a lot more money than this life insurance policy will pay out. My employer offers a $1m term policy they pay for, but at this point with no debts excluding that new loan, and enough cash to pay that off tomorrow if I wanted, I don't see any real benefit my wife or I would receive from any life insurance that I would have to pay for - and I'm really really thinking of just cashing this whole life policy out and putting the cash value into my Roth IRA. 

&#x200B;

I can see how someone with a huge load of debt would want enough life insurance to cover paying those loans off when they die so their family is not stuck with the loans - but when you are on the other end of that bridge debt free, I just don't see any benefit at all to life insurance if you have cash that will be passed along to beneficiaries.",life insurance waste money debt free s situation 150 annual premium 25k death benefit 3 5k cash value life insurance policy s generating 72 dividend income latest 1099 div received x200b mortgage car loans dinks opened outstanding loan replacing windows french doors house 38 years old wife 39 x200b m questioning right having insurance honestly pass away 401k lot money life insurance policy pay employer offers 1 m term policy pay point debts excluding new loan cash pay tomorrow wanted don t real benefit wife receive life insurance pay m thinking cashing life policy putting cash value roth ira x200b huge load debt want life insurance cover paying loans die family stuck loans end bridge debt free don t benefit life insurance cash passed beneficiaries,post,investing,2024-02-03 17:33:28,0.49,,0,,1403,268,2024-02-03,17,Saturday

1fw9dxq,"Three consumer discretionary falling knives you can try to catch. I like all three of these stocks at their current prices. They are all quite volatile and yes this is knife catchy, but the turnaround will likely be quite sharp when it comes

Stellantis - The most maligned company in the most maligned sector recently. Poor sales, particularly US sales in H1. Very high inventory. Price cuts in H2 to clear out the inventory ready for 2025 models. There have also been some cuts in production, and cost cutting. Earnings likely to be poor for the next few quarters, but they will be back on track in a year or two IMO. They do have a very well diversified portfolio of brands and a good mix of market exposure. Their balance sheet is exception for an automaker. 

Dr. Martens - UK based retailer with global exposure. Distinctive bootwear which has had an almost cult like following at various points in the past. Sales have been very poor over the past 2 years. The sales drop is again worst in US market, which has seen a strong decline in bootwear sales generally, although Dr Martens have fared somewhat worse. They are predominantly a one product company which makes it more risky but also more potentially rewarding. Positive sides are very attractive margins and a still reasonably good balance sheet. 

Burberry - UK luxury company. Again, suffering sharp drops in sales. This one is at a slightly earlier stage than the other two. Currently, there are no significant corrective actions in place, management argue they aren't needed and they probably won't be if we see a rebound in luxury. Decent amount of China exposure if interested. Excellent margins as you would expect. Balance sheet fine. Of the three, this is one I am least confident of, I can imagine things may get worse before they get better.

1fyyhys,"Medpace (MEDP): My quick overview. **My Investment Thesis:**

MEDP is a well-established contract research organization (CRO) that focuses on late-stage drug development, primarily serving small and midsize biotech firms. The company’s deep expertise in managing complex, multinational trials and its high customer switching costs create a substantial economic moat. Medpace’s global regulatory knowledge and ability to shorten clinical trial times give it a significant advantage, supporting long-term client relationships.

Financially, Medpace shows strong growth and has a $2.9 billion backlog. The company has a healthy balance sheet, low debt, and focuses on organic growth. However, recent project cancellations and the need to stay innovative present challenges. With a fair price estimate of $394.83, Medpace appears undervalued by about 13%, offering upside potential for long-term investors. At least, a very good choice for a watchlist and regular checks.

**Company Overview:**

» A contract research organization (CRO)   
» Focuses on late-stage drug development   
» Offers full clinical trial services to small and midsize biotech, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies   
» Provides extra services, like bioanalytical lab work and imaging capabilities   
» Started over 30 years ago and now has more than 5,800 employees in 40 countries   
» Mainly operates in the U.S., but it also has locations in Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, and Australia

**CEO:**

August J. Troendle (68), M.D. has been the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Medpace since he founded the company in July 1992.

**Strengths:**

» Healthy backlog of $2.8 billion   
» Deep expertise   
» Dedicated project teams

**Risks:**

» Increased project cancellations   
» Must continually invest   
» Product governance risks

1g1jjb5,"G13 - Genting Singapore. This is an interesting business IMO.

They own 'Resort World Sentosa', an integrated resort on a small island in Singapore. It is one of only two sites in Singapore where gambling is legal. 

Aside from the casino, they have a Universal Studios theme park, oceanarium, water park, 4 hotels, villas, and many restaurants.

Revenues went off a cliff during covid, but they impressively managed to avoid losses. They are now close to 2019 profitability, and the outlook is good, with further expected increases in the number of foreign visitors. The outlook would be further improved by a China rebound.

The profit margins are very high, and they have a moat with their casino business. 

Trades at 15x earnings, with EV/EBITDA around 6, although this is low partly because they have a Japanese-style cash pile. Despite that, they do have a high payout ratio, typically 70% or better, with the current dividend yield around 4.6%.

I recently watched a video discussing PepsiCo's current financial situation, and it raised some interesting points about the company's dividend sustainability. With a market cap of $230 billion and a hefty debt load of $73 billion, [Pepsi's 3% dividend yield](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/PEP/dividends) consumed a staggering 95% of its free cash flow last year. This raises the question: is this dividend sustainable in the long run?



While Pepsi has shown consistent profit margins around 10% and decent returns on invested capital, the revenue growth has been relatively flat, hovering in the low single digits. The video also highlighted that even though Pepsi is a well-known brand, its growth potential seems limited compared to competitors like Monster Beverage.



Given these factors, do you think Pepsi's dividend is at risk if the company faces any financial headwinds? How do you view the balance between dividends and reinvestment in a company like PepsiCo?

1g1wt7u,"Analysts reactions' to China Stimulus measures announced earlier today - ""Underwhelming, but they are pointing in the right direction now"". SINGAPORE (Reuters) -China said on Saturday it will ""significantly increase"" government debt issuance to offer subsidies to people with low incomes, support the property market and replenish state banks' capital as it pushes to revive sputtering economic growth.

Without providing details on the size of the fiscal stimulus being prepared, Finance Minister Lan Foan told a news conference there will be more ""counter-cyclical measures"" this year.

Global financial markets have been keenly awaiting more details on China's stimulus plans, fearing its 2024 economic growth target and longer-term growth trajectory may be at risk if more support is not announced soon.

Here are some comments from investors and analysts on the press briefing from China's finance ministry:

RONG REN GOH, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, EASTSPRING INVESTMENTS, SINGAPORE

""Investors were hoping for fresh stimulus, accompanied by specific numbers, to be announced at the MOF presser, including the size of these commitments. From this perspective, it turned out to be somewhat of a damp squib given only vague guidance was provided.

""That said, there were meaningful measures announced. The MoF affirmed room for the central government to increase debt, more support for housing markets, and increased local government debt quotas to alleviate refinancing woes.

""However, with markets focused on 'how much' over 'what', they were invariably set up to be disappointed by this briefing.""

HUANG XUEFENG, CREDIT RESEARCH DIRECTOR, SHANGHAI ANFANG PRIVATE FUND CO, SHANGHAI

""The focus seems to be around funding the fiscal gap and solving local government debt risks, which far undershoots expectations that had been priced into the recent stock market jump. Without arrangements targeting demand and investment, it's hard to ease the deflationary pressure.""

ZHAOPENG XING, SENIOR CHINA STRATEGIST, ANZ, SHANGHAI

""MOF focused more on derisking local governments. It will likely add new quotas of treasury and local bonds. We expect a 10 trillion yuan ($1.42 trillion) implicit debt swap in the next few years. Official deficit and local bond quotas may both increase to 5 trillion yuan going forward.  But it looks (to be) not much this year. We expect 1 trillion ultra-long treasury and 1 trillion local bonds to be announced by NPC this month end.""

BRUCE PANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST CHINA, JONES LANG LASALLE, HONG KONG

""The message released from today's press conference is actually quite in line with the expectations of those familiar with China's policy-making process and state structure. The officials have given answers to questions of 'how' but no details of 'when', yet.

""I will expect more details and number of the previewed fiscal stimulus to be published only after the upcoming meeting of the NPCSC to approve a plan to increase treasury issuance and provide a mid-year revision to the national budget. And it would be reasonable and practical to keep room for policy manoeuvring to prepare for external shocks and uncertainties.""

CHRISTOPHER WONG, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, OCBC, SINGAPORE

""There was mention of 2.3 trillion yuan and some details on local bond issuance that can support housing ... but it stopped short of a big surprise factor. That said, we shouldn't lose sight of the bigger picture and that is policymakers acknowledged the issues and are putting in genuine effort to tackle those issues.

""More time may be needed for more thought-out and targeted measures. But those measures also need to come fast as markets are eagerly waiting for them. Over expectations vs under-delivery would result in disappointment and that can manifest itself into Chinese markets.""

TIANCHEN XU, SENIOR ECONOMIST, ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT, BEIJING

""Our overall take is quite positive in that MoF is willing to tackle China’s many economic challenges by leveraging its borrowing room. The immediate benefits to the economy will be limited, as the MoF avoided large-scale direct cash handouts to households.

1fsue7e,"ROCE to Cash Accumulation in Pulak Prasad's book. In “What I Learned About Investing from Darwin”, Pulak Prasad says

*Company X growing its sales at 10 percent with ROCE of 25 percent can grow from zero cash to a cash balance of almost 18 percent of sales in five years (other assumptions: margin 15 percent, tax 30 percent). With an increasing cash cushion, X’s management team can choose to launch new products or target new geography. Even if the new business fails, X can recover given its ability to generate cash from its core business. Now let’s look at its competitor, Y, which is growing at the same rate (10 percent) with the same margin (15 percent) but with a lower ROCE of 12 percent. In five years, Y would have a negative cash balance of 3 percent of revenue. In other words, Y would have to borrow to grow at the same rate as X.*

His point is that all else being equal, a high ROCE business will generate more cash than a low ROCE business. And rough math holds up the argument.

But I can't seem to get close to his numbers. I'd appreciate any help in understanding the arithmetic.  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For company X, the book says ""*almost 18 percent*"". My number is higher at 21%.

For company Y, my number of -3.6% is closer to the what the book says.

I have made the following assumptions:

* ROCE = EBIT / Capital employed
* Free cash not added to capital employed (Says so in the book)
* No debt and so no interest payment
* ""Margin"" means operating margin, i.e. EBIT = Revenue X Margin
* Ignored all other complications and kept it simple.

I have 10 data points to determine the probability distribution for my Monte Carlo simulation of the business value of a company. I have 2 choices. 

* First is to find the best fit curve and then use this to generate the simulated value for the parameter. 
* Second is just to use a triangular distribution since there is only 10 data points. 

Some thoughts on the choices from Chat GPT

a) Fitting a distribution can provide a more nuanced understanding of your data, but with only 10 points, it may not yield reliable results.

b) A triangular distribution is straightforward to implement and requires only three parameters: minimum, mode, and maximum. This can make it a good choice when data is limited.

I've been exploring potential investment opportunities with Rollman Capital and Rollman Mining. Both organizations caught my interest with their focus on investment management and Bitcoin mining services, respectively. Rollman Capital promotes a conviction-driven investment approach, aiming to blend performance with a positive societal impact. Meanwhile, Rollman Mining is all about providing access to Bitcoin mining through procurement of miners, software, pools, and hosting services, emphasizing professional-level equipment for both private and professional clients.  
  
My curiosity led me to a video call with the CEO of Rollman Mining, where we discussed various aspects of their services, including costs, potential ROI, and the specifics of their Bitcoin mining operations. While the conversation was enlightening, offering deep insights into their business model and promises of transparency and high returns, I'm left wanting to cross-reference these claims with independent experiences.  
  
Given the scarcity of independent reviews and a lack of publicly available financial data or significant third-party media coverage, I'm reaching out to this knowledgeable community for any personal experiences or insights you might have about Rollman Capital or Rollman Mining. I'm particularly interested in:

1aro8ij,"No load, no fee money-market Mutual Funds with minimums > $1 but less than $1M?. I currently put some cash in the mutual fund SNOXX, short-term, because it gets over 5% interest. It has a $1 minimum investment which is super convenient for using for ""loose ends"" in a brokerage account. It yields a heck of a lot more than most cash sweeps, and is only slightly less flexible because I can get the money out of it by the end of the day and then trade with it a couple days later at the latest. Unlike savings accounts there is no transaction limit per month so it's perfect for temporary money storage, and rebalancing purposes in a portfolio.

I notice that there are also funds that are similar, but have minimum balances of $1M, which, understandably, yield a bit more (often as much as 0.25% more), probably because of lower expense ratios because they have fewer little transactions. I have nowhere near this level of cash.

However, I would love to find something intermediate between it and these higher-yield, higher-minimum-balance ones. I don't particularly need the full flexibility of the $1 minimum balance nor do I really need to be able to trade in $1 increments.

Like if I'm buying / selling in increments of $100, $1,000, or $10,000, but am nowhere near the $1M mark, is there any way to squeeze another 0.05% or 0.1% or so return, out of some similar mutual fund that has the same basic flexibility? Or are there ones where if I keep a minimum of say $10-20k, I could trade it in any increment?

but what if you sell shares of a stock at a loss, and then buy them immediately (at or around the same price)? Would there be any difference compared to if you did nothing?

it seems one difference might be taxes - since losses affect taxes, to ultimately make more profit, does it make sense to sell stocks at a loss, then buy them again?

1ef9o6c,"AI Trading Tools: A Boon for the Market or a Threat to Fairness?. Hey everyone,

I’ve been exploring some new trading tools lately, and one that’s been getting a lot of attention on tiktok and for good reason is trademind.ca—essentially ""ChatGPT for stocks."" It’s got me thinking about a potentially explosive issue: Are AI trading tools enhancing the market, or are they fundamentally skewing it?

Here’s the issue: With AI tools like TradeMind, some traders are getting access to high-level analytics and predictive capabilities that were once out of reach. While this can be incredibly empowering, it also raises questions about fairness. Are we creating a trading landscape where those who can afford or choose to use these advanced tools have an unfair advantage over everyone else?

The controversy really heats up when you consider this: Is the proliferation of AI tools contributing to a more competitive and efficient market, or is it driving a wedge between the ""tech elite"" and the average trader? Could these tools be consolidating power in the hands of a few, making it nearly impossible for those without access to compete on an equal footing?

Some argue that AI tools are just the latest evolution in trading, giving savvy users a competitive edge that’s no different from traditional advantages like insider knowledge or high-speed trading platforms. Others worry that we’re heading toward a scenario where only those with the latest tech can thrive, while the rest of us are left scrambling for scraps.

What do you think? Are AI trading tools a step forward in making markets smarter and more efficient, or are they a threat to fair competition?

1aj2rf2,"Roast me: I’m a financial advisor who charges AUM. I’m a financial advisor with about 15 years of experience under my belt, and so much of the feedback I see on Reddit is so negative toward advisors that pay AUM, so I thought I’d ask for your feedback

I charge based on AUM, but very little of what I do is related to investment management. I run my practice like a family office with the following services on an unlimited basis:
1. Investment management (largely passive, sophisticated hands on management including tax loss harvesting, building out individual bond ladders, providing access to alternative investment opportunities like late stage venture capital, real estate, and private equity). 
2. Cash flow planning - helping clients envision how much money they’d need to make a significant purchase (new home, relocation, etc), or to retire. 
3. Legal/estate planning - I not only provide initial suggestions for estate planning, I refer my clients to an attorney specifically selected from my network and I also sit in on every call they have with the attorney throughout the estate planning process. I act as the coordinator for every project and am with clients each step of the way. 
4. Tax advisory- my firm provides in house tax advice, and I have connections with CPAs, corporate tax planners, and tax attorneys. If a client is in need of any of these professionals, I also sit in on each of these calls to ensure I can manage a clients project properly.
5. Balance sheet management - I only get paid for my AUM, but I also advise on items that I can’t manage. I will provide input outside investment opportunities clients get from their personal networks or other investment institutions. I discuss writing individual checks to startup companies, and participate in conversations about cryptocurrency investments. 

I feel like I do a lot for my AUM fee, which starts at 0.65% and declines to 0.4% at $10M. However, it doesn’t seem like the world thinks very highly of what I do for a living.

VTI will outperform VOO by about 1-3% per year for the next few years.

Once interest rate cuts begin, the small caps that make up about 15% of VTI will start to perform well versus the stagnation they faced over the last few years due to lower borrowing costs, better risk appetite, etc.

**Returns over the last 5 years: VOO = 82% | VTI = 75.5%.**

I’ve got about $8,000 laying around, doing nothing in my bank account, and I’ve been looking to invest it in more index funds. I’m in my late 20s, so I want to rebalance my portfolio to have more stocks as opposed to cash.

For the past year or so, I’ve been using Robinhood for dollar-cost averaging in VOO and QQQ (I started using RH when I was in grad school and a buddy sent me a referral link). 

Now, would it be better to switch to a more “traditional” account, say Fidelity (which handles my 401k, so I’ve had it in mind), or keep using Robinhood and invest the $8,000 in there, and transfer my current portfolio?

Any pros and cons to either?

1ai3xt5,"US Treasury Bond vs. Global Aggregate Bond ETF when treasury has higher yield. Aggregate bond funds seem to be the usual recommendation for the bond component in a portfolio.  To compare them with treasury, I looked into the [Vanguard USD Treasury Bond UCITS ETF (VUTA)](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/bond/9598/usd-treasury-bond-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating) and the [Vanguard Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF (USD Hedged) (VAGU)](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/bond/9600/global-aggregate-bond-ucits-etf-usd-hedged-accumulating).

||VUTA (Treasury)|VAGU (Global Aggregate)|

|Effective Yield to Maturity|4.1%|3.8%|
|Average Maturity|7.9 years|8.8 years|
|Average Duration|6.2 years|6.8 years|
|Average Quality|AA+|AA-|
|TER|0.07%|0.10%|

I thought the higher YTM and (presumably) lower default risk mean that VUTA will have a higher expected return, but [Vanguard's own 10-year forecast](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/vemo-return-forecasts.html) predicts a better return from global bonds instead:

|Median volatility|5.6%|4.4%|5.9%|

Where can the \~1% excess return possibly come from? And when combined with stock funds in a portfolio, should I pick VUTA based on the higher effective YTM and a lower market correlation, or VAGU due to a higher predicted return despite the lower effective YTM? Thanks for your help.

1g1xvwi,"Research and detailed analysis on High Tide inc ( $HITI : Nasdaq). **Background** - How [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) became the leading cannabis retailer in Canada

**The beginning**:

Raj Grover, the founder and CEO who owns \~9% of the company and has never sold a single share (not even when it was trading 5x higher than it is today), comes from an entrepreneurial family and had already experienced success with several smaller businesses before establishing [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click). During a business trip to India in search of opportunities in fashion accessories or body jewelry, Raj stumbled upon the potential of cannabis consumption accessories. Recognizing the margin arbitrage opportunity, he shipped $10,000 worth of consumption accessories from New Delhi to Canada and sold everything overnight. After replicating this success a few more times, Raj decided to open a store. **This marked the beginning of High Tide's story**.

In 2009, Raj opened Smokers’ Corner with an initial investment of less than $50,000 and grew it into a multimillion-dollar empire. At that time, there were only two or three competitors with unappealing stores. Raj believed that by creating a differentiated store in a smart location, he could easily capture market share, and he was right. By leveraging his established roots in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and India, he was able to not only provide a better customer experience but also offer much cheaper products.

**Cannabis legalization in Canada**:

Always looking to stay ahead, Raj seized the opportunity when the Prime Minister of Canada announced that recreational cannabis would soon be legalized. With an existing customer base of cannabis users, it made perfect sense for Raj to expand into selling cannabis itself. He realized that if he only sold accessories, he would eventually lose customers to shops that offered both cannabis and accessories.

After nine years of focusing on consumption accessories and accumulating nearly $10M in retained earnings, Raj raised $88.5M for the first time in 2018 and ventured into the equity markets, marking **the beginning of High Tide's journey as a publicly traded company**. With easier access to capital when compared to its peers, High Tide expanded its footprint across Canada, highlighted by the significant acquisition of its competitor Meta in 2020, which increased the number of stores from 37 to 67.

**The strategy shift that made everything change**:

Around the same time, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) began acquiring e-commerce businesses selling accessories and CBD-related products (mostly oils) with higher margin profiles, **a pivotal decision for the company**. From acquiring several brands in the U.S., such as Smoke Cartel, FABCBD, Daily High Club, DankStop, and NuLeaf Holdings, to later acquiring BlessedCBD in the UK, High Tide leveraged its market power to **enhance margins** and diversify its revenue streams.

In the summer of 2021, [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) was accepted for listing on the Nasdaq, marking a significant milestone.

Later that year, a transformative decision was made: **High Tide launched a discount club model for its retail stores in October 2021**. With consolidated margins higher than any competitor due to the previously mentioned CBD-related acquisitions, High Tide could offer cannabis at remarkably low prices, **attracting loyal members and rapidly gaining market share**.



Although this discount model initially involved selling cannabis at a loss, **the move proved to be incredibly successful**. High Tide's market share increased from less than 4% to over 10% in less than three years, despite representing less than 5% of the total cannabis retail store count. **Today, the discount model program has more than 1.5M members and continues to grow each quarter**.

Being the first-of-its-kind discount model was the key differentiating factor that propelled High Tide to become the",research detailed analysis high tide inc hiti nasdaq background hiti leading cannabis retailer canada beginning raj grover founder ceo owns 9 company sold single share trading 5x higher today comes entrepreneurial family experienced success smaller businesses establishing hiti business trip india search opportunities fashion accessories body jewelry raj stumbled potential cannabis consumption accessories recognizing margin arbitrage opportunity shipped 10 000 worth consumption accessories new delhi canada sold overnight replicating success times raj decided open store marked beginning high tide s story 2009 raj opened smokers corner initial investment 50 000 grew multimillion dollar empire time competitors unappealing stores raj believed creating differentiated store smart location easily capture market share right leveraging established roots indonesia thailand china india able provide better customer experience offer cheaper products cannabis legalization canada looking stay ahead raj seized opportunity prime minister canada announced recreational cannabis soon legalized existing customer base cannabis users perfect sense raj expand selling cannabis realized sold accessories eventually lose customers shops offered cannabis accessories years focusing consumption accessories accumulating nearly 10 m retained earnings raj raised 88 5 m time 2018 ventured equity markets marking beginning high tide s journey publicly traded company easier access capital compared peers high tide expanded footprint canada highlighted significant acquisition competitor meta 2020 increased number stores 37 67 strategy shift change time hiti began acquiring e commerce businesses selling accessories cbd related products oils higher margin profiles pivotal decision company acquiring brands u s smoke cartel fabcbd daily high club dankstop nuleaf holdings later acquiring blessedcbd uk high tide leveraged market power enhance margins diversify revenue streams summer 2021 hiti accepted listing nasdaq marking significant milestone later year transformative decision high tide launched discount club model retail stores october 2021 consolidated margins higher competitor previously mentioned cbd related acquisitions high tide offer cannabis remarkably low prices attracting loyal members rapidly gaining market share discount model initially involved selling cannabis loss proved incredibly successful high tide s market share increased 4 10 years despite representing 5 total cannabis retail store count today discount model program 1 5 m members continues grow quarter kind discount model key differentiating factor propelled high tide,post,ValueInvesting,2024-10-12 11:16:14,0.55,"HITI,UK",2,NASDAQ,4066,596,2024-10-12,11,Saturday

1g20xoc,"quality, value oriented writer pushing my own stuff. Hey guys!

I am a 31 year old guy from Norway, who earlier this year started writing about my investment process through a newsletter.

I actually learned and got started investing through Reddit and this platform propelled my curiosity forward.

I have written around 15 articles so far. They range from me reflecting on stuff I learn, and how we can take advantage of research and factors to become better investors to business rundowns on individual companies.

My portfolio consists of the following companies:
1. SanLorenzo
2. O'Reilly Automotive
3. Evolution AB
4. Constellation Software
5. Visa 
6. Kinsale Capital Group
7. Hermes
8. Norbit ASA
9. Paradox Interactive
10. Topicus
11. AQ Group
12. NCAB Group

As you can see, I have a twofold strategy: Own large, great companies growing predictably over time and smaller nordic/European companies with good growth and which the market underestimates.

I define myself as a quality growth investor, meaning that I seek companies that have long lasting competitive advantages and long runways for growth. 

I would love to discuss with more people, and get feedback from anyone on my processes and investments. The Substack is called Learning to Grow, and it's all about me reflecting on and sharing stuff I learn as I read about investments and research companies. I try to present original and lesser known opportunities. My goal is for my writing to be an open journal of investments, where I can become a better investor through my writings.

I of course think all the stuff I write is of quality, but I want to highlight three pieces I'm particularly happy with:

1. My deep dives into two individual companies: [Paradox Interactive](https://growthbylearning.substack.com/p/paradox-interactive-a-gem-in-the) and [Norbit](https://growthbylearning.substack.com/p/norbit-a-profitable-problem-solver)

1fsxvfq,"Cashflow & ROCE calc from Pulak Prasad's investing book. In “What I Learned About Investing from Darwin”, Pulak Prasad says

*Company X growing its sales at 10 percent with ROCE of 25 percent can grow from zero cash to a cash balance of almost 18 percent of sales in five years (other assumptions: margin 15 percent, tax 30 percent). With an increasing cash cushion, X’s management team can choose to launch new products or target new geography. Even if the new business fails, X can recover given its ability to generate cash from its core business. Now let’s look at its competitor, Y, which is growing at the same rate (10 percent) with the same margin (15 percent) but with a lower ROCE of 12 percent. In five years, Y would have a negative cash balance of 3 percent of revenue. In other words, Y would have to borrow to grow at the same rate as X.*

His point is that all else being equal, a high ROCE business will generate more cash than a low ROCE business. And rough math holds up the argument.

But I can't seem to get close to his numbers. I'd appreciate any help in understanding the arithmetic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For company X, the book says ""*almost 18 percent*"". My number is higher at 21%.

For company Y, my number of -3.6% is closer to the what the book says.

I have made the following assumptions:

* ROCE = EBIT / Capital employed
* Free cash not added to capital employed (Says so in the book)
* No debt and so no interest payment
* ""Margin"" means operating margin, i.e. EBIT = Revenue X Margin
* Ignored all other complications and kept it simple.

1fwkpp0,"Spirit Airlines- It's always darkest before pitch black. I'm going through the latest 10K for Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) as there are rumors of bankruptcy proceedings. Really, what an obvious death spiral. Clearly, they were losing a game of catch up with debt while hopelessly trying to improve their operating margins.

If one looks at the cash flows going back to 2022, one can see that they are issuing more and more debt while trying to service existing debt. They're even paying premiums to get out of certain debts early. All with -$500 million in operating losses annually. Notably, they pay off 1.5 billion in debt over 3 years, only to issue $1.7 billion more in debt and $375 million stock in the same period. They even pay $600 million to exit some debts early.

  
As low as their market cap is and as cheap as their bonds might be, it does me no good to be a shareholder of a cash burning machine that cannot easily be acquired (see JetBlue's failed acquisition of Spirit) or a bondholder of a company that will have a hard time liquidating and a harder time servicing the debt.

Additionally, backtesting should be a priority, focusing on specific times or blocks of hours in the market, rather than trying to trade the entire session.

1fz3o77,"200 Melco International Development - Hong Kong. I've not bought this stock yet and not sure if I will, would like to hear some thoughts.

Melco International Development is a Hong Kong based casino company, operating casinos mainly in Macau, catering to mainly tourists from mainland China.

I am not into casinos but I must say these look very nice:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Dreams_(casino)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_City_(Macau)

Main page:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melco_International_Development

They have opened a City of Dreams in Cyprus, but I wish they had stayed focused on their core market tbh.

If you look at the financials, you'll see they got whammed by Covid and the ridiculously overdone lockdowns.

They have still not returned to profit on a net income basis.

But it is very clearly coming. EBITDA is strongly positive, and on an EV/EBITDA basis they are around 9. The balance sheet is a mess because they had to take on a lot of debt around Covid, but they have already started clearing that down and it is on a nice trend. If they were to regain 2019 profitability, their PE would be around 11.

They may also have a moat. Gambling is illegal in China, aside from a state run lottery. The Chinese government wants people to go to Macau if they want to gamble. There is competition within Macau, but licensing is strictly controlled and there are only a few players in the game.

However, there is a massive black market for gambling. Per China's own estimates, it probably draws twice the revenue of their state run lotteries. Chinese users can connect to a VPN and bet with shady companies in Philippines, Cambodia etc. Proxy betting, via a phone, is also a popular option for high net worth clients.

I do wonder if the government will cave at some point and legalise online gambling to collect that sweet revenue. That would be, on the face of it, bad for Melco, but, it is also possible that they would have an advantage in gaining licences for online services, and therefore in fact, it would open up a massive new market for them. Maybe I'm being too optimistic? 

Couple of other notes:

The CEO is western educated and highly decorated:

They are audited by Deloitte and in compliance with Hong Kong accounting standards (which are legit)

1fz43xz,"ALTO and Ethanol Stocks are severely undervalued. The market seems to be missing the fundamentals in the ethanol sector.  Corn prices were elevated with the start of the Russia/Ukraine war, but have since come down significantly leading to ethanol crush margins to expand.  For the quarter ended September 30th, Crush margins were extremely elevated and this will start flowing to the balance sheets in earnings. 

ALTO Ingredients trades at less than half tangible book value, and if you look recently that $GEVO purchased an ethanol plant for $210 million dollars and that plant had 65 million gallons of annual capacity.  ALTO has 350 million gallons of annual capacity and it affirms that the assets are undervalued and the market is missing this.   ALTO has about $100 million in debt and the current market cap of $123 million so the potential for value unlock is there in assets alone  

Operationally high crush margins will flow to the balance sheet and crush margins have eased the last month, they still remain higher than than the historical norm for this time of year.  US Ethanol demand is expanding as more fueling stations roll out E15/Unleaded 88 gasoline which is a 15% ethanol blend compared to the typical 10% blend, as these roll out it creates more demand, however US Ethanol exports have seen a big surge upwards as other countries are blending more ethanol into their gasoline, as Europe increases their blends and Japan is poised to increase blending from 3% to 10%, along with other nations, Vietnam, China and others studying higher blending, the export markets look to only increase.  

The other big benefit that is going to drive ethanol demand is ethanol is a good feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel, it takes about 1.7 gallons of ethanol to produce 1 gallon of SAF, and the SAF market is growing rapidly in the United States and other nations, plus the added benefit is tax credits for using SAF which will drive demand and the potential for tax credit benefits for ethanol producers to flow to the bottom line, along with Carbon Capture and Storage which ALTO and others have been investing in.   

ALTO seems poised to rally due to being near the lows, based on assets and also a strong and robust ethanol market that currently seem out of favor with Wall Street.",alto ethanol stocks severely undervalued market missing fundamentals ethanol sector corn prices elevated start russia ukraine war come significantly leading ethanol crush margins expand quarter ended september 30th crush margins extremely elevated start flowing balance sheets earnings alto ingredients trades half tangible book value look recently gevo purchased ethanol plant 210 million dollars plant 65 million gallons annual capacity alto 350 million gallons annual capacity affirms assets undervalued market missing alto 100 million debt current market cap 123 million potential value unlock assets operationally high crush margins flow balance sheet crush margins eased month remain higher historical norm time year ethanol demand expanding fueling stations roll e15 unleaded 88 gasoline 15 ethanol blend compared typical 10 blend roll creates demand ethanol exports seen big surge upwards countries blending ethanol gasoline europe increases blends japan poised increase blending 3 10 nations vietnam china studying higher blending export markets look increase big benefit going drive ethanol demand ethanol good feedstock sustainable aviation fuel takes 1 7 gallons ethanol produce 1 gallon saf saf market growing rapidly united states nations plus added benefit tax credits saf drive demand potential tax credit benefits ethanol producers flow line carbon capture storage alto investing alto poised rally near lows based assets strong robust ethanol market currently favor wall street,post,ValueInvesting,2024-10-08 16:33:05,8.19,"ALTO,GEVO",2,NASDAQ,2302,391,2024-10-08,16,Tuesday

1apur6l,"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?. Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.

Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.  


It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.  


Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.

1arpw2b,"CZR - Caesars Entertainment 'Research'. Was in Las Vegas February 7-13, 2024. Stayed at the Horseshoe (CZR strip property). I have a traditional ""lads' trip to Vegas Super Bowl weekend every year (this was my 6th trip) - extended a bit more this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs ""mid-market' properties

Noticed that the high-end properties (Cosmo, Aria) were hopping and jammed. (note: not CZRs properties). 6-8 craps tables operating Thursday and Friday night, with $50-$100 minimums. By contrast, the CZR properties across the street (Planet Hollywood (PH), Paris, Horseshoe, Linq, Flamingo) were much quieter. For instance, PH only had 3 $15 craps tables on Thursday night.

Tables seemed no busier than previous years at the mid-market CZRs properties. Hypothesis is that the ""gambling / partying"" crowd was priced out this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs Execution Risk

PH's marquee 'Heart Bar' was being renovated and converted to a chandelier / glass bar. The new bar was not ready Wednesday-Thursday-Friday during the day of Super Bowl week. (It eventually opened Friday at midnight). Not a good look to have a marquee drinking/party hangout not ready to go for one of the busiest times of the year.

Craps dealers at Paris (Friday night) and Horseshoe (Sunday night) were a long way from being centre-strip Vegas quality. Odds are ""meh"" and limits are high - there is really no reason to make a gambling trip to Vegas - your local casino likely has better dealers, lower limits, and better odds.

CZRs restaurants

Restaurants (Nobu at Paris, Bugsy/Meyers at Flamingo) were busy and an excellent value. So were the cocktails at Vanderpump (Paris).

Conclusion

Overall, the crew this year was a bit frustrated with the CZRs experience and may look elsewhere for our next strip.

Given the shifts due to deglobalization and the evolving dynamics in global supply chains, l've zeroed in on two ETFs that seem promising: $GRW and $SUPP.

1. $GRW (Global Compounders ETF): This ETF is all about targeting high-ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) companies with durable moats and sustainable earnings growth. These firms are adept at reinvesting their earnings at high rates of return, essentially compounding capital over time.

2. $SUPP (Supply Chain Logistics ETF): With the current reconfiguration of supply chains and increased emphasis on logistical resilience, $SUPP invests in pivotal players within the logistics and supply chain management sectors.

This ETF aims to leverage the increased capital flows into infrastructure and supply chain optimization amidst global trade recalibrations.

I'm looking for insights on the potential risk-return profiles of these ETFs and their alignment with current macroeconomic indicators. Are there particular volatility concerns or market conditions I should monitor with these investment themes?

Also, if you have other ETFs or securities in mind that align with these themes, please share!

1efhf1h,"Advice for Paying off a Mortgage Early. I've been putting in $950 a month to pay off a 25 year mortgage (original loan $228k) at 3.25% with a current balance of $184000. I planned originally to pay it off via ETF's in a brokerage, so I'd built up a brokerage account of $31k (grown $6k since I started).

That $950 was chosen because that would have paid off the house by the age I wanted to retire when I first did an amortization to pay off early by Mid 2032. I'm going to change that to a round $1000.

I might add that I opened a brokerage account as I wanted a secondary backup for emergency savings, but my saving account has built up enough for that not to matter. Therefore I am transferring at $8k a year, starting this year from brokerage into a personal Roth IRA.

So with the above in mind, what are you thoughts on the following options:

a)  Play it safe, and keep on paying the mortgage off early, but now at mid 2033 and pay off the rest with whatever the personal Roth IRA/Brokerage.

b) Invest the $1000 into a work Roth 403b (in additional to my other retirement investments).

If you think b) is the way to go, how would you advise % split into which investments, considering enough growth to have made not going route a) worthwhile, but looking to get around 8%, with a minimum of 6% average growth.

3.) If I do only US large/mid/small in my 403b/457b, that is approximately 76% of my retirement allocation there. Should I reset my Roth IRA allocations to all international to get close to global market?

1ebdcm7,"Investing in bonds is funding corruption and waste, while being tricked into thinking you’re profiting, when in reality you’re still losing and being outpaced by inflation (rate of debasement). # Funding Waste:

* **California High-Speed Rail Project**: This project, intended to connect major cities in California, was originally budgeted at $33 billion but ballooned to over $100 billion. It has faced numerous delays, with only a small section under construction and no clear completion timeline​ ([Senator Rand Paul](https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-releases-2023-festivus-report-on-government-waste/))​​ ([The Beacon](https://blog.independent.org/2023/12/26/2023-festivus-government-waste/))​.
* **Afghanistan Reconstruction Projects**: Billions were invested in various reconstruction efforts, many of which were abandoned or mismanaged, leading to significant waste. Issues included corruption, poor planning, and lack of sustainability​ ([Senator Rand Paul](https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-releases-2023-festivus-report-on-government-waste/))​.
* **Border Wall Construction**: Estimated to cost $15 billion, this project faced numerous challenges and was largely halted with the change in administration. The incomplete sections and subsequent restoration efforts have been costly​ ([Senator Rand Paul](https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-releases-2023-festivus-report-on-government-waste/))​.

These projects highlight significant financial waste due to mismanagement, shifting political priorities, and other issues.

# Funding Corruption:

**2008 Financial Crisis Bailouts**

* **Summary:** The U.S. government bailed out major banks and financial institutions with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), injecting hundreds of billions to prevent a financial system collapse.
* **Corruption:** Executives of bailed-out banks received large bonuses, despite their companies' failures. Some government officials had close ties to these institutions, leading to conflicts of interest and favoritism.

**Automobile Industry Bailout (2008-2009)**

* **Summary:** The U.S. government provided over $80 billion to General Motors and Chrysler to avoid bankruptcy and save jobs.
* **Corruption:** Executives retained high salaries and bonuses. Political connections influenced the distribution of bailout funds, benefiting certain stakeholders disproportionately.

**Airline Industry Support during COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)**

* **Summary:** Over $50 billion in government aid was given to major airlines to cover payroll and prevent bankruptcies.
* **Corruption:** Some airline executives received significant compensation packages. There were instances of misuse of funds, with companies prioritizing stock buybacks and executive pay over employee support.

In all cases, corruption involved individuals within corporations and the government benefiting personally, often at the expense of taxpayers and the broader public interest.

# Bonds being outpaced by Money Supply Inflation:

When examining the return on bonds relative to the rate of debasement (the percentage increase in money supply) over the past decade, we observe that the average growth rate of the M2 money supply has often outpaced bond yields, leading to diminished real returns on bonds.

1. **Money Supply Growth**: Over the past ten years, the M2 money supply in the U.S. has grown significantly. For example, data from the Federal Reserve shows that the M2 money supply increased from approximately $10.5 trillion in 2014 to around $21.02 trillion in 2024​ ([FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL))​​ ([YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_m2_money_supply))​. This represents an average annual growth rate of about 6-7%​ ([YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_m2_money_supply))​​ ([CEIC Data](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/united-states/m2-growth))​.
2. **Bond Yields**: During the same period, the yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds have averaged around 2-3%. These yields are often influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policies and global economic conditions. For instance, post-2008 financial crisis policies kept interest rates low to stimulate the",investing bonds funding corruption waste tricked thinking profiting reality losing outpaced inflation rate debasement funding waste california high speed rail project project intended connect major cities california originally budgeted 33 billion ballooned 100 billion faced numerous delays small section construction clear completion timeline senator rand paul beacon afghanistan reconstruction projects billions invested reconstruction efforts abandoned mismanaged leading significant waste issues included corruption poor planning lack sustainability senator rand paul border wall construction estimated cost 15 billion project faced numerous challenges largely halted change administration incomplete sections subsequent restoration efforts costly senator rand paul projects highlight significant financial waste mismanagement shifting political priorities issues funding corruption 2008 financial crisis bailouts summary u s government bailed major banks financial institutions troubled asset relief program tarp injecting hundreds billions prevent financial system collapse corruption executives bailed banks received large bonuses despite companies failures government officials close ties institutions leading conflicts interest favoritism automobile industry bailout 2008 2009 summary u s government provided 80 billion general motors chrysler avoid bankruptcy save jobs corruption executives retained high salaries bonuses political connections influenced distribution bailout funds benefiting certain stakeholders disproportionately airline industry support covid 19 pandemic 2020 summary 50 billion government aid given major airlines cover payroll prevent bankruptcies corruption airline executives received significant compensation packages instances misuse funds companies prioritizing stock buybacks executive pay employee support cases corruption involved individuals corporations government benefiting personally expense taxpayers broader public interest bonds outpaced money supply inflation examining return bonds relative rate debasement percentage increase money supply past decade observe average growth rate m2 money supply outpaced bond yields leading diminished real returns bonds 1 money supply growth past years m2 money supply u s grown significantly example data federal reserve shows m2 money supply increased approximately 10 5 trillion 2014 21 02 trillion 2024 fred ycharts represents average annual growth rate 6 7 ycharts ceic data 2 bond yields period yields 10 year u s treasury bonds averaged 2 3 yields influenced federal reserve s monetary policies global economic conditions instance post 2008 financial crisis policies kept interest rates low stimulate,post,investing,2024-07-24 21:35:18,0.17,,0,,4194,511,2024-07-24,21,Wednesday

I just want something that I can use essentially as a check register. I currently use clearcheckbook.com but twice in the last week have tried to log in only to find the site down.

Each month I put in our paychecks, then each bill/transaction we'll be making during the month and then I know that I can save/invest whatever the difference is, and I just check off the transactions throughout the month as they clear.

I track my net worth thru Merrill Lynch, as that's where my retirement accounts are, so i'm not super concerned about the app being able to do that either, but I wouldn't turn it down if that was a feature.

I don't mind paying a small subscription fee as it's worth it to me to work with an app/site where I know my data won't be lost.

1aj4c8b,"A story of hope - $1,000,000. 7 years ago I hit rock bottom - I found out my wife was having an affair which led to a divorce and caused myself and my two kids to move back into my parents house because I could not afford my house payment 

At the time I had $15,000 in retirement and lived pay check to pay check.  At that time I made $60,000 a year

I got serious about my money at that time and started to budget.  I also focused on my savings rate and at least save 20% - 30% into retirement 

A year after the divorce I met a great girl and we got married.  She brought $80,000 of retirement money into our family which gave us about $100,000 in our 403b.  At the time she made $50,000.

7 years later we are making $200,000 a year and have been saving 30% and we now have a net worth over $1,000,000

We still enjoyed vacations, travel sports so we def have not stopped living life.  My biggest advice is we drove cheap cars ( we both have Honda accords that are older) so we never did car payments and used the cheapest car insurance .

A hot stock market helped but now I realize it’s more about savings rate than anything else and just live within your means and eliminate unnecessary debt.

We probably will hit $1,000,000 in stocks alone in another two years

Most people have no idea who the biggest shareholder of Tencent is. They assume it’s a Chinese billionaire or a big tech firm. Wrong. It’s Naspers—a South African media company that nobody even associates with cutting-edge technology. It’s like hearing that your local bakery owns 30% of Apple.

So how did this unknown company land the investment of a lifetime? By doing the one thing almost every investor screws up: **sitting tight**. Seriously, that’s it. They just sat on their hands while everyone else played musical chairs.

With a market cap of $110 billion and an enterprise value of $156 billion, UPS is a major player in the shipping industry. However, the video highlighted a concerning trend: the company's profit margins have been declining, with a five-year profit margin of 8% [dropping to just under 6%](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/UPS/financials/metrics) in the trailing twelve months.



The speaker also pointed out that while UPS has substantial debt, this is not unusual for a capital-intensive business like shipping. They noted that the free cash flow has been consistent but is shrinking, which could be a red flag for potential investors. 



Given the recent revenue trends, which show a tapering off after a spike during the pandemic, it raises the question: Are we seeing a return to ""normal"" shipping levels, or is there a more significant shift happening in consumer behavior?

1fzau9x,"26 year old - IRA question, which sole company would you buy and hold? Please see body text.. I’m 26 and relatively new to managing my investments on my own. I have a $25,000 Traditional IRA, which is a rollover from an old 401(k), currently invested in FXAIX. I’m considering reallocating this entire Traditional IRA into a single stock, such as Amazon (AMZN) or CrowdStrike, with the intention of holding it for 10-15 years. The goal is to grow this position significantly and then reinvest the gains into an index fund later. I’m thinking that, while I’m young, taking a concentrated position could help build up my index fund holdings over time.

1g25tsx,"After Tesla's 'We Robot' Event, How Are You Valuing the Company Now?. I've always considered Tesla primarily as a car company. After all, the bulk of their revenue comes from selling electric vehicles! But after watching the We Robot event, I'm starting to rethink that stance.

They unveiled the Optimus Robot, a humanoid robot that's supposed to handle tasks that are dangerous for humans. And in Elon's words, they ""can even watch your kids"" 😂. Then there's talk of the CyberCab, an autonomous ride-sharing concept that could disrupt the entire transportation industry and steal Uber's business. No other automotive manufacturer is diving this deep into AI, autonomous vehicles and robotics.

So here's where I'm torn: Should we still value Tesla based on traditional automotive metrics, or is it time to start looking at it as a tech or AI company? Their AI, energy storage, and robotics advancements seem to set them apart from other car manufacturers.

What do you all think? Does Tesla's push into AI and robotics change how you value the company? Is it fair to compare them to other tech giants instead of automakers?",tesla s robot event valuing company ve considered tesla primarily car company bulk revenue comes selling electric vehicles watching robot event m starting rethink stance unveiled optimus robot humanoid robot s supposed handle tasks dangerous humans elon s words watch kids s talk cybercab autonomous ride sharing concept disrupt entire transportation industry steal uber s business automotive manufacturer diving deep ai autonomous vehicles robotics s m torn value tesla based traditional automotive metrics time start looking tech ai company ai energy storage robotics advancements set apart car manufacturers think tesla s push ai robotics change value company fair compare tech giants instead automakers,post,ValueInvesting,2024-10-12 17:57:33,0.31,AI,1,NYSE,1125,187,2024-10-12,17,Saturday

1apvrs0,"Why Not 100% Equities - AQR. New post from Cliff Asness (link at the bottom). Read the whole thing, but here are a few shortened takeaways.

* I don’t know anyone who thinks a portfolio of stocks and bonds has a higher unconditional expected return than 100% stocks. We prefer a diversified portfolio because we believe it has a higher return for the risk taken, not a higher expected return.

* In general we should separate the choice of 1) what is the best return-for-risk portfolio?, and 2) what risk we should take? This new paper, and many like it, confuse the two. If the best return-for-risk portfolio doesn’t have enough expected return for you, then you lever it (within reason). If it has too much risk for you, you de-lever it with cash.

* Rising valuations (since the 1990s) have made equities themselves (and especially the USA vs. ex-USA differential) a very likely overestimation of the future.

* Simply looking at historical results and urging investors to “buy the thing that’s gone up the most over the long term” is not financial analysis, it is finger painting.

tl;dr For the love of god, stop just saying ""buy VT and chill""

> The bulk of the money that universities drew down from their endowments last year was spent on financial aid. Schools used nearly 48% of their **distributions,** on average, for that purpose, according to the report. 

Emphasis added. The whole point of the article is these top universities spend very little. 48% of the single digit % they spent. They’re acting like retirees. And that they’re spending 4% or something.

> Private foundations are required to spend at least 5% of their assets on charitable functions each year. Universities had an average endowment-spending rate of 4.7% last year, according to the survey. At universities with endowments over $1 billion, the average rate was 4.5%

> on average, schools use their endowments to pay for 11% of their annual operating budgets, the study found. Schools with larger endowments said they funded 17% or more of their budgets.

> between fiscal years 1988 and 2023, the share of endowment assets allocated to alternative investments, like private equity and venture capital, went from less than 10% to more than 50%

1at0rcx,"My wife's 401K rollover- with Empower- is lost in bureaucracy!. My wife had almost $300,000 in her Empower 401K.  When she lost her job she decided to roll over the funds in her 401K into an individual IRA.  (She could have kept the money in her 401K but had lots of fees and limited investment options.)

She looked into moving the money over to Fidelity where she had an investment account, but got nervous when they told her they (Empower) would mail her a check which she would then have to present to Fidelity. The Internet is full of horror stories of 401K Rollover checks being lost or stolen from the mail.  This happened to two different friends of ours and it took them nearly a month to get it all settled and the money was out of the stock market during a month the market was booming.

So my wife decided to keep the money with Empower and open an Empower IRA so she would simply do a direct 401K to IRA Rollover within the same company.  It was suppose to be easy with no paper check. 

So two weeks ago the money was taken out of her 401K account and it now shows zero.  Every day she checks the Empower IRA Account and that shows a ZERO Balance.  The money is lost in computer bureaucracy and not getting any investment returns. The Empower Website says this should only take 2-3 business days!

Every three days she calls the Customer Service Number of Empower and after sitting on hold for 30-60 minutes an unhelpful person answers the phone and tells my wife the transfer (401K to Rollover IRA) **is in process.**

This could happen with any company doing a direct no check 401K to IRA Rollover.

1edx5gy,"What is your honest and educated in the current state of the S&P 500 and the ""bubble"" forming?. I made sure this question hasnt been asked much lately so i hope i dont sound like a broken record.

This is a serious question as i have been having doubts  myself lately.

My primary source for this information is morning star, this is purely for analytics. 

The S&P 500 asset allocation specifically is what has me worried. Currently 33% of the asset allocation is in technology, with 2nd place being financial services at 12%, 3rd healthcare at 11%. The gap difference from 3rd to 4th onwards is fairly humble, being only 1-5% difference. And yet the gap difference between tech and financial services is a whopping 21%. Its obvious as to why, technology is the largest industry for most of the 21st century and our relience on it in our daily lives shows how dominant it is. 

Technology is also a really broad industry and really should be sub categorised. 

But despite that fact, i have a looming worry over whether much of the earnings and revenue gains of the top 7 companies of the 500 is purely due to Ai Hype. Not to mention the top 7 companies in the 500 holding more than 30% of the total allocation of the 500 fund. 

Is AI proving to be a productive industry? Or is the hype unwarranted. I work with AI in my day job and i definitely see the benefits and productive use of it. Its likely a new industrlial revolution.

There has been a general atmosphere of fearmongering occuring where i am constantly hearing the s&p 500 is in a bubble and ready to pop. But the reasons people are giving differ. Some say its purely ai, others say simply because its a top heavy allocation within a handful of companies, others say its an overreliance on the tech industry as a whole, or some say its because of the growth heavy asset state of the s&p. Ive also seen the comparison to the .com bubble but i have to disagree with this as Ai has tangible productive capabilities which generate work and make processes more efficient (though not all ai tools are made equal, its just a general statement), whereas the .com bubble was for the most part not comparible. Investors just threw money at domains with .com as a suffix without analysing the productive capabilities of those companies.

However id be lying if i didnt say the top heavy concentration of asset allocation with the s&p 500 is making me a little worried. Afterall the point of an index fund is to mitigate risk and over exposure to a limited number of industries and markets, so the current state of the 500 fund does have me a bit worried.

Id be interested to hear some differing perspectives.",honest educated current state s p 500 bubble forming sure question nt asked lately hope nt sound like broken record question having doubts lately primary source information morning star purely analytics s p 500 asset allocation specifically worried currently 33 asset allocation technology 2nd place financial services 12 3rd healthcare 11 gap difference 3rd 4th onwards fairly humble 1 5 difference gap difference tech financial services whopping 21 obvious technology largest industry 21st century relience daily lives shows dominant technology broad industry sub categorised despite fact looming worry earnings revenue gains 7 companies 500 purely ai hype mention 7 companies 500 holding 30 total allocation 500 fund ai proving productive industry hype unwarranted work ai day job definitely benefits productive use likely new industrlial revolution general atmosphere fearmongering occuring constantly hearing s p 500 bubble ready pop reasons people giving differ purely ai simply heavy allocation handful companies overreliance tech industry growth heavy asset state s p ve seen comparison com bubble disagree ai tangible productive capabilities generate work processes efficient ai tools equal general statement com bubble comparible investors threw money domains com suffix analysing productive capabilities companies d lying nt heavy concentration asset allocation s p 500 making little worried afterall point index fund mitigate risk exposure limited number industries markets current state 500 fund bit worried d interested hear differing perspectives,post,investing,2024-07-28 02:29:58,0.29,AI,1,NYSE,2662,480,2024-07-28,2,Sunday

1ak5vkk,"When do you know it's time to go it alone and ditch your FA?. I started my investing journey about 10 years ago after receiving a windfall. I think I did ok (didn't lose any money) but my returns weren't that good, all things considered. 3-4% for some years and 4-6% in other years. 

I was doing a more thorough audit of my finances this year and I regretted not just putting everything in a few choice ETFs...until I remind myself that I didn't know then what I know now. Plus there were other factors in the way such as family entanglements and unhealed mental illness. 

I initially thought that to be an Investor (TM) you needed to understand every single thing on every broadsheet and watch the markets 24/7...until I did more reading and spoke to a friend of mine who is a full-time investor and she says that she doesn't know all that. You need to know enough to make money consistently, that's it.

So I while do know what are alpha, beta, Sharpe Ratio, candlestick theory are etc...I just want to manage my money, I'm not trying to become a CPA. For what it's worth, most FAs that I speak to are impressed with my knowledge base. 

However, I believe in always being humble and learning more, hence this post. Is there a point to when you feel that you can go it alone? When Googling this question the answer that always comes back is ""everyone's situation is different"" different factors etc. But here I'm talking mainly about financial knowledge and how to apply it.

Basically at this point I would be happy to buy several Vanguard growth ETFs and kick back and relax while saving the fees that I pay my FA. As long as I am navigating any potential traps like not paying witholding taxes, I don't see any issues with that strategy as it's hard to beat the market. The S&P and related ETFs are gold standards for a reason, and some of the funds rebalance themselves. 

tldr; do I know enough to invest safely long-term?

1al4igr,"The Stigma of Stock Picking. Stock picking often gets a bad rap, therefore redditor's often default to suggesting new investors purchase the S&P or any comparable fund. Though this could be considered the safe route, it does little to teach new investors about the market as a whole. 

Stock picking is like a dark art, and is something I vowed to learn and master early on (or at least quit losing money in). Firstly, diversification is important. There's no way around it. Your level of diversification can vary, but owning an excessive amount of companies will only assure you'll do average at best.

Many give Cramer flak, but there's one comment he'd often make I'd like to highlight: ""Buy best of the best"". If you opted to buy the best companies per sector, beating the market isn't impossible...but picking stocks is half of the equation. ""Buying a wonderful company at a fair price"" is the other half.

I often stress the psychology of investing. Something I didn't become cognizant of until I started day trading. The market often pulls in new investors during euphoria, and this is the absolute worst time to invest. 

Many novice (and somewhat experienced) investors can't stomach market corrections, so be mindful of the affect a correction can have on someone who got in at the highs during euphoric conditions. A 10% drop in a stock isn't something to lose sleep over for someone who's up 100% or so...but imagine the affect a 10% drop can have on a new investor. They'll likely want to stop the bleeding, considering they'll immediately be in the red. 

Resist following the herd. Usually when some shiny new thing is being touted on social media, smart money is already looking for the exit. Invest in companies you can understand. Invest in products you already use or would consider using, granted they have sustainable growth. I often avoided shopping at Walmart because it was always crowded. I decided to research the company to determine what that traffic translated to. That was around $52 a share. I realized when you turn on every computer, you were greeted by Microsoft Windows. That was $38 a share. It can be that simple.

Investors definitely shouldn't be deterred from stock picking. Just be cognizant of the business and disciplined in your entry.

However somehow all other carmakers are deadbeats? EVs might be the future but the ‘green transition’ is happening later than the market makes it seem to be, while the other legacy carmakers are trailing at <10 PE ratios. 

I hold stellantis and am looking into GM, I get the sentiment that stellantis looks really cheap on paper but is falling apart in their product competitiveness and that GM has a lot of liabilities, just like most automakers at the moment, but when big tech is selling at over 30 PE, aren’t legacy automakers the things value investors should be looking for?

1fx14am,"Is Palantir the Next Big Tech Stock or Overvalued Hype?. # Overview

Palantir Technologies Inc. has shown strong performance recently, driven by significant growth in its U.S. commercial and government sectors. The company has been recognized for its ability to deliver enterprise AI solutions at scale, which has been a key differentiator in the market. Recent strategic partnerships and expansions, such as those with Tampa General and Panasonic Energy, highlight its focus on leveraging AI to enhance operational efficiencies. Additionally, Palantir's inclusion in the S&P 500 index and its strategic moves in AI and defense sectors have positively impacted its market perception.

# Fundamental Analysis

* **Revenue and Profitability**: Palantir reported a 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 2024, with total revenue reaching $678 million. The U.S. commercial sector saw a 55% increase, while the government sector grew by 23%. The company achieved a GAAP net income of $134 million, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of profitability. This growth is attributed to strong demand for AI-driven solutions and strategic commercial contracts, although revenue from these contracts is expected to decline. ✅
* **Strategic Positioning**: Palantir is heavily investing in AI and enterprise solutions, with a focus on transitioning from prototype to production. Its strategic partnerships and product innovations, such as the AIP and Warp Speed initiatives, align with its goal to dominate the AI and defense sectors. These efforts are expected to drive long-term growth and strengthen its competitive position. ✅
* **Risks**: Key risks include competitive pressures in the AI sector, potential regulatory challenges, and geopolitical tensions, particularly in regions like the Middle East. These factors could impact Palantir's ability to maintain its growth trajectory and profitability. ⚠️Subscribed

# Technical Analysis

* **Price Movements**: Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility, with a recent surge to a 52-week high of $39.29. The stock has shown strong upward momentum, reflecting positive market sentiment.
* **Key Indicators**: The RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a price correction. The MACD shows a bullish trend, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating strong momentum. ✅
* **Support and Resistance Levels**: Key support is around $30, with resistance at the recent high of $39.29. These levels suggest potential entry and exit points for traders.

# Investment Recommendation

* **Valuation Insights**: With a trailing P/E ratio of 230.82 and a forward P/E of 91.26, Palantir appears overvalued compared to industry peers. However, its strong growth prospects and strategic positioning in AI may justify a premium valuation. ⚠️
* **Short-term Outlook**: Given the current momentum and market conditions, Palantir is expected to continue its upward trend in the short term. Short-term investors might consider a buy, but should be cautious of potential volatility. ✅
* **Long-term Outlook**: Palantir's investments in AI and strategic partnerships position it well for long-term growth. However, investors should be mindful of the risks associated with geopolitical tensions and market competition. Overall, it is a **hold** for long-term investors. ✅
* **Final Recommendation**: Considering both the fundamental and technical analysis, Palantir is a **hold**. While it has strong growth potential, the current valuation and market risks suggest caution. ⚠️",palantir big tech stock overvalued hype overview palantir technologies inc shown strong performance recently driven significant growth u s commercial government sectors company recognized ability deliver enterprise ai solutions scale key differentiator market recent strategic partnerships expansions tampa general panasonic energy highlight focus leveraging ai enhance operational efficiencies additionally palantir s inclusion s p 500 index strategic moves ai defense sectors positively impacted market perception fundamental analysis revenue profitability palantir reported 27 year year revenue growth q2 2024 total revenue reaching 678 million u s commercial sector saw 55 increase government sector grew 23 company achieved gaap net income 134 million marking seventh consecutive quarter profitability growth attributed strong demand ai driven solutions strategic commercial contracts revenue contracts expected decline strategic positioning palantir heavily investing ai enterprise solutions focus transitioning prototype production strategic partnerships product innovations aip warp speed initiatives align goal dominate ai defense sectors efforts expected drive long term growth strengthen competitive position risks key risks include competitive pressures ai sector potential regulatory challenges geopolitical tensions particularly regions like middle east factors impact palantir s ability maintain growth trajectory profitability subscribed technical analysis price movements palantir s stock experienced significant volatility recent surge 52 week high 39 29 stock shown strong upward momentum reflecting positive market sentiment key indicators rsi indicates overbought conditions suggesting potential price correction macd shows bullish trend macd line signal line indicating strong momentum support resistance levels key support 30 resistance recent high 39 29 levels suggest potential entry exit points traders investment recommendation valuation insights trailing p e ratio 230 82 forward p e 91 26 palantir appears overvalued compared industry peers strong growth prospects strategic positioning ai justify premium valuation short term outlook given current momentum market conditions palantir expected continue upward trend short term short term investors consider buy cautious potential volatility long term outlook palantir s investments ai strategic partnerships position long term growth investors mindful risks associated geopolitical tensions market competition overall hold long term investors final recommendation considering fundamental technical analysis palantir hold strong growth potential current valuation market risks suggest caution,post,ValueInvesting,2024-10-05 21:42:14,0.18,"AI,AIP,RSI",3,BOTH,3542,519,2024-10-05,21,Saturday
1fzcx5g,"Blue Bird Corp is in value investing territory. **Context**

**About the company**  
An American school bus manufacturer, who are #1 in US, and are positioned to dominate the market because:

* Highest % of non-diesel buses. Strong focus on electric
* Enjoys strong brand equity primarily for being a specialised player in buses

**Market Size**

* Total school buses: 515K
* Average fleet age: 11 years (most states set 15 years as a replacement target)
* Yearly replacement % - 6-7
* Yearly buses sold #- \~31K
* Yearly buses sold value- $4.5B (Average value \~150K)
* Average value over time has been increasing by 5-10% YOY due to electrification of fleet (EVs cost nearly 3X as much

[Source](https://s23.q4cdn.com/152250413/files/doc_presentations/2024/Aug/19/blbd-investor-presentation-august-2024.pdf)

**Catalysts**

* Infrastructure Law of 2021 authorizes EPA to offer rebates and grants to replace existing school buses with clean / zero-emission models – $5B Funding over 5 years
* 2024 Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicles Program \~$650M for School Buses

The above initiatives have created the following head-winds to expand the market:

* Faster replacement cycles
* Due to focus on clean energy, increase in AOV by about 5-10% every year

Due to these reasons, I would assume the market to grow by at least 5% in terms of volumes, and another 5-10% in terms average value leading to a cumulative growth of 10-15%. In the interest of being conservative, I have modelled 10% revenue growth for the next 5 years

**Valuation**

* Revenue growth over next 5 years: 10%
* Terminal growth: 2%
* Net margin: 7.6% to 8% over 5 years
* Discount rate: 12%

DCF Value: 47 (Stock is trading at a 10% discount)

**Risks**

* Leadership is a big pain. Phil Horlock (63) was to retire and pass the baton to Britton Smith resigned a month before the transition. So Phil Horlock has decided to continue, and is now both the CEO and President. Britton Smith attributed the resignation to personal reasons, but he is now in the market looking for a new job (source: his linkedin profile). If only we knew why Britton Smith **really** left
* Insider selling by the CEO has been relentless. Partly understandable because he is over 60 and would look to diversify funds
* Republican government will not be as generous with clean energy funds

**Overall**

kzkzdwm,"The simple answer is to use angel list.  On angel list, you aren't actually an angel investor, you give money to an angel investor and they invest it.

Technically, what you are buying into is a partnership (a special purpose vehicle) that is governed by a bunch of rules, but mostly just exists to own shares in a startup.  The head of that partnership is the actual angel investor and they will get a cut (usually 20%) of any gains you make.  Minimum investments in these are usually in the $1k to $10k range and technically they are only open to accredited investors.

They also have a rolling funds (https://www.angellist.com/rolling) which are more like a ETF.  You give the angel investor so much every quarter, and they pick the investments.  I avoid these becasue of the fee structure and lack of ability to choose particular investments.

People think that you won't see the good companies on angel list, but it's not true.  First, these are mostly early stage companies raising less than $1 million.

kzlqajx,"I been buying treasuries from Vanguard. It’s pretty easy. You go on their web site and pick what you want to  buy in thousand dollar increments. I buy at auctions direct from the government through Vanguard,  because the money is in an IRA and you can’t do those through Treasury Direct. Seems like buying from third parties and not direct from the government , the quantities you have to buy can be pretty high, like 100k at a time, so I do the treasury auctions instead because I  want to buy much smaller amounts.

I wouldn’t buy treasuries directly unless you’re absolutely sure you want to hold them to maturity. In that case the interest goes direct into your brokerage account and then the principal at maturity. I always hold to maturity and never sell, but I think the problem selling is similar to buying. At least from Vanguard you have to sell a lot at once usually,  more than I have usually.

Auctions are usually once a month for each term, a bunch under a year, then 2 year, 3 year, 5 year, 10 year, 20 year and 30 year. You look at Treasury Direct for the next upcoming auction and then put in the order with your broker a few days before that date. You don’t actually bid in the auctions, only the big banks do that. You get the same rate that they bid more or less, but you don’t know the exact rate until the auction is over.",buying treasuries vanguard s pretty easy web site pick want buy thousand dollar increments buy auctions direct government vanguard money ira t treasury direct like buying parties direct government quantities buy pretty high like 100k time treasury auctions instead want buy smaller amounts wouldn t buy treasuries directly absolutely sure want hold maturity case interest goes direct brokerage account principal maturity hold maturity sell think problem selling similar buying vanguard sell lot usually usually auctions usually month term bunch year 2 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 20 year 30 year look treasury direct upcoming auction order broker days date don t actually bid auctions big banks rate bid don t know exact rate auction,comment,investing,2024-04-14 23:14:51,,,0,,1345,252,2024-04-14,23,Sunday

It's a bank holding company across the American West, based out of Washington with a market share in the PNW that looks to slot in right below the major nationals. They merged last year with another regional, Umpqua Holdings Corp. The quick and dirty:

* Price today: $20.58
* Book value per common share: $23.68
* Tangible book value per common share: $16.08
* Tier-1 Capital Holdings: 9.8%
* ROA: 0.92% today but consistently hovering around 1%
* ROE: 9.89 today but in the teens over the past few years
* ROI: 5.18%
* P/B: 0.87
* P/E (if you care with a bank): 8.82
* Net charge-off: 0.47% (up with the general trend right now, but comparable to WFC at 0.50%)

Population and income growth in its markets (WA, CA, ID, OR, UT, AZ, CO) is expected to slightly outperform the national trend in coming years. Its numbers are slightly down lately but seemingly due to more general factors affecting banking/the economy as a whole.

lwu4gpu,"Right, but neither of those are industries like Apple in 2003.

In 2003, Apple was a niche home computing company, with even smaller B2B division. It had resurrected its profitabilty by reducing its offerings, not really expanding. 

But... it had recently just released the iPod (a novel, but lackluster product) and then the iTunes Store. Suddenly, it had a cash cow that revolutionized the game and went on to develop the market that would become dominated by the iPod. Then the iPhone and App Store shortly afterwards.

It's hard to say in 2003, that Apple would've been that behemoth and back then someone on a thread like this would be saying something like ""look at what the company has produced in the last 23 years: lackluster performance.""

So, in a way, for the closest comparison we should be looking at a company that's about 25-30 years old, IPOed about 20 years ago, and has just recently returned to profitability and released new products within the last 2 or so years, that might just go on to develop a whole new market space.",right industries like apple 2003 2003 apple niche home computing company smaller b2b division resurrected profitabilty reducing offerings expanding recently released ipod novel lackluster product itunes store suddenly cash cow revolutionized game went develop market dominated ipod iphone app store shortly s hard 2003 apple ve behemoth thread like saying like look company produced 23 years lackluster performance way closest comparison looking company s 25 30 years old ipoed 20 years ago recently returned profitability released new products 2 years develop new market space,comment,investing,2024-11-13 00:10:59,,,0,,1045,182,2024-11-13,0,Wednesday

lwvb5be,"You could just do the Schwab index Target Date Funds. It's mostly stocks early on and then leans into fixed income later on.


 Or you could do 80-100% VT (world index fund) and 0-20% BND for US bonds or BNDW for world bonds. 


AOA and AVDE are examples of a low cost all in fund that don't change their allocation over time. AOA is 80% global stocks and 20% bonds straight up and forever.  AVDE is a small cap value tilted fund of funds but mostly sticks to the low-cost broad market exposure with that factor tilt. Factor exposure is a whole other can of worms that may or may not be worth getting into.

Or you could just stick with the robo advisor, that's likely going to do OK, basically the same thing you should be doing anyway but 8% cash is kind of high for a retirement account especially with so long to compound.

l4h7mu4,"Coming back to this post, as I don’t see any updates in the subreddit.

You see that local grinders have all their needs met? Somewhat older news, but that despite local harvests anticipated to be down 30% YOY out of the region, local grinders were prioritized and are well covered and will have no shortage of beans, despite the general drop in production. 

Hershey is one that would be in that group of local grinders. So this gives more confidence that this noise will not be significant.

Thinking about the qualitative and psychological factors associated with how the company operates and conduct business, and when said factors act and combine together, create a very strong force or hedge against what’s going on (sort of a lalapalooza scenario):

- HSY requires wholesalers to pay a living wage premium that goes back to the producers/farmers. While the local governments decide what farmers get paid, and there’s corruption and issues in that part, Hershey regularly petitions for better conditions and pay, and have dumped hundreds of millions into improving the communities of producers with schools for the children, clean water wells, sustainable farm management practices, etc. 

All of this takes advantage of the reciprocity principle in psychology, the principle that when one party is treated favorably, humans tend to reciprocate with another positive action or favor. 

Given grinders were given priority, this is clearly the results of their efforts of improving the regions paying off. Even though it’s likely the government that allowed for the prioritization, it’s still a reciprocal act. You take care of the hand that feeds you. This is a powerful concept that shows the strength of the company’s supplier relationships.

You also have other regions like Brazil who are now planting more cacao crops to take advantage of the temporary spike in price. And this will also put downward pressure on the supply side of the equation. More producing regions will try and take a piece of the pie until a high price can no longer be exploited because everyone participating increases overall supplies. Companies such as HSY are also pushing for diversification in producing regions and that will just always be a continuing effort in the background.  Sure it takes 3-5 years to see cocoa produced but this all bodes well for the future.

Anyways, just more info coming through that validates my thesis that the company will get through this just fine. And is better equipped to handle this today than they were in 1977. 

I believe with the implementation of the S/4 system, and the efficiencies that will bring to the company’s distribution and preparation process cannot be understated. And then the further efficiencies from the AAA initiative that will benefit in future years will mean more earnings growth. And then once cocoa falls, all those price pack architecture and price changes will come to margin. 

I’m very excited to see all these factors combine and provide strong earnings growth in future years and decades. Sure it’s possible we have an inflationary recession between now and 2030, given we are in the “hangover” phase of monetary base led inflation. Especially if the Fed doesn’t pull of their soft landing miracle (would be the first time in history we don’t see an inflationary recession), but that won’t matter in the long run either, and honestly could just provide more buying opportunities if the market was depressed enough.",coming post don t updates subreddit local grinders needs met somewhat older news despite local harvests anticipated 30 yoy region local grinders prioritized covered shortage beans despite general drop production hershey group local grinders gives confidence noise significant thinking qualitative psychological factors associated company operates conduct business said factors act combine create strong force hedge s going sort lalapalooza scenario hsy requires wholesalers pay living wage premium goes producers farmers local governments decide farmers paid s corruption issues hershey regularly petitions better conditions pay dumped hundreds millions improving communities producers schools children clean water wells sustainable farm management practices etc takes advantage reciprocity principle psychology principle party treated favorably humans tend reciprocate positive action favor given grinders given priority clearly results efforts improving regions paying s likely government allowed prioritization s reciprocal act care hand feeds powerful concept shows strength company s supplier relationships regions like brazil planting cacao crops advantage temporary spike price downward pressure supply equation producing regions try piece pie high price longer exploited participating increases overall supplies companies hsy pushing diversification producing regions continuing effort background sure takes 3 5 years cocoa produced bodes future anyways info coming validates thesis company fine better equipped handle today 1977 believe implementation s 4 system efficiencies bring company s distribution preparation process understated efficiencies aaa initiative benefit future years mean earnings growth cocoa falls price pack architecture price changes come margin m excited factors combine provide strong earnings growth future years decades sure s possible inflationary recession 2030 given hangover phase monetary base led inflation especially fed doesn t pull soft landing miracle time history don t inflationary recession won t matter long run honestly provide buying opportunities market depressed,comment,ValueInvesting,2024-05-17 16:41:30,,HSY,1,NYSE,3473,570,2024-05-17,16,Friday

l0qs148,"This type of article highlights why it’s important to do further DD, and that correlation doesn’t equal causation.

Ford, GM, and pretty much every other EV maker is seeing the exact same pullback in the exact same groups of people. Now how did old Elon convince democrats that they shouldn’t buy rivian? How did he convince them they shouldn’t buy a VW ID series? He didn’t. 

For a tiny fraction of political extremists, Elon may be the root cause for avoiding Tesla. For the other 99.9% of consumers, high rates and competition in China have slowed EV sales everywhere. In the US, EV sales peaked in 2H last year and since then growth has slowed to basically 0. Since democrats were historically buying more EVs than independents or republicans, they have the largest proportional pullback. 

These Reddit comments sections are almost always full of bias on topics like this. Go back to when Netflix was cracking down on passwords. It’s thousands of anecdotes that people are cancelling their subscriptions, when in reality Netflix was seeing record user sign ups. 

Go back to when Facebook was burning billions on the metaverse. It was hundreds of anecdotal comments that they never used Facebook anymore and it was a dying app when in reality all of their usage statistics were at all time highs. 

Elon is no different. The hundreds who hate him are the ones who post on these threads, while the millions of people who don’t care and just want a cheap vehicle are simply waiting for rates to come down and more EV chargers to be built. The internet would have you believe Tesla is headed towards bankruptcy. In reality they’re the only EV maker still expanding their production facilities and actively building new manufacturing and battery plants.",type article highlights s important dd correlation doesn t equal causation ford gm pretty ev maker seeing exact pullback exact groups people old elon convince democrats shouldn t buy rivian convince shouldn t buy vw d series didn t tiny fraction political extremists elon root cause avoiding tesla 99 9 consumers high rates competition china slowed ev sales ev sales peaked 2h year growth slowed basically 0 democrats historically buying evs independents republicans largest proportional pullback reddit comments sections bias topics like netflix cracking passwords s thousands anecdotes people cancelling subscriptions reality netflix seeing record user sign ups facebook burning billions metaverse hundreds anecdotal comments facebook anymore dying app reality usage statistics time highs elon different hundreds hate ones post threads millions people don t care want cheap vehicle simply waiting rates come ev chargers built internet believe tesla headed bankruptcy reality ev maker expanding production facilities actively building new manufacturing battery plants,comment,stocks,2024-04-22 14:08:54,,"DD,GM",2,NYSE,1755,298,2024-04-22,14,Monday

It sort of does , shorting cost money to borrow a stock you have to pay interest on it sort of like borrowing money

Because there are not a lot of stocks to borrow (Major owners are locked up and cannot lend their shares) the cost is absurd like 500% if you lent it for an entire year

So even if you could find a share are you willing to pay such a high price to short it? There is some what an equilibrium at play here

l4h820d,"The Chinese government has a program where they are paying foreigners to make social media posts that promote China. 

A lot of the one's I've seen, pick the best of what China has and compare it against the worst of what the US has. 

The reality of it all is, China does have some things they do better, but they also have things they do much worse. 

My experiences in my multiple visits to mainland china:

Subways are very clean and assuming you aren't handicap or traveling with small children, very good. The downside, are things like, stairs to the handicap elevator, or elevators that are broken or shut down. 

food and housing are pretty low cost there, but you could also say that of many other countries. 

medical care there: you need to pay up front or you won't get any medical care. you also need to plan on at least an entire day for any type of medical care, you'll be waiting around through most of it. While the cost is close to what you would pay with insurance in the US, US health care is far faster and has far more convenient options. I had one of my kids with me who needed a nebulizer in china, which resulted in an entire week consumed mostly at the hospital, where the same thing in the US gets you a portable nebulizer and a prescription and you have more time not waiting around in the hospital. 

city cleanliness: much like the US, it really depends on where you are. I've seen large groups of rats moving around in the down town financial districts of Guangzhou before, but I've also seen similar in NY. China when you get out of the cities, you see a lot more poverty, unmaintained roads, and things like that, you don't have the suburban areas  like what you think of in the US, though I've seen similar in countries other than China as well. 

Homelessness I do thing asia in general has an edge on the US in this. Partially due to culture and closeness of family, but also, at least in china, because they are pretty good about grabbing up people with mental problems and institutionalizing them, and most asian countries have very severe laws around drugs. between those factors, you do see homeless in China, just not very many, and nowhere near the scale you see in some US cities.",chinese government program paying foreigners social media posts promote china lot s ve seen pick best china compare worst reality china things better things worse experiences multiple visits mainland china subways clean assuming aren t handicap traveling small children good downside things like stairs handicap elevator elevators broken shut food housing pretty low cost countries medical care need pay won t medical care need plan entire day type medical care ll waiting cost close pay insurance health care far faster far convenient options kids needed nebulizer china resulted entire week consumed hospital thing gets portable nebulizer prescription time waiting hospital city cleanliness like depends ve seen large groups rats moving town financial districts guangzhou ve seen similar ny china cities lot poverty unmaintained roads things like don t suburban areas like think ve seen similar countries china homelessness thing asia general edge partially culture closeness family china pretty good grabbing people mental problems institutionalizing asian countries severe laws drugs factors homeless china near scale cities,comment,ValueInvesting,2024-05-17 16:43:58,,,0,,2223,407,2024-05-17,16,Friday

l4kq5pj,"I think your friend sounds pretty rational, however…

Here are a few things for him to consider:


- Most great/prominent investors have acknowledged that your intelligence is less important than your ability to stomach making the obviously correct decision.  I believe Warren Buffet said something once about having super high intelligence with regard to analysis is almost useless if you don’t have the stomach for buying/holding through irrational price drops.  Plenty of smart people talked themselves out of buying Carvana at $4/share.  

- The reason many top hedge funds can’t beat the market isn’t because it is so difficult, or because they are not smart investors.  It is because their AUM is so high that they are unable to invest in the easy wins, which are smaller market cap companies.  Buffet has said as much as well.  You become a victim of your own success.  You might know of a $200m company that is almost certainly going to bring in market beating returns over the next 5 years, but if you’re managing >$1Bn dollars it doesn’t matter.  

- You can have worse analysis and still be a better investor.  Being an analyst is only part 1.  Have you ever read the post on this subreddit about Carvana being on a highway to bankruptcy? Half decent analysis, but not written by someone with the mind of a value investor.  There is a comment under that post asking OP, “At what price would you buy Carvana stock?” OP answered “There is no price.”  Which fundamentally illustrates that it doesn’t matter how good of an analyst you are when you don’t have the guts for value investing.

Every single stock in the world is worth purchasing at the right price.  If a company is 95% likely to go bankrupt and close its doors within 1 year, but the price upside within that year for a non-bankruptcy outcome is 100x, that is a +ev investment.  That’s not to mention when a good company lands in a position where the market has priced for failure even though failure is highly unlikely.",think friend sounds pretty rational things consider great prominent investors acknowledged intelligence important ability stomach making obviously correct decision believe warren buffet said having super high intelligence regard analysis useless don t stomach buying holding irrational price drops plenty smart people talked buying carvana 4 share reason hedge funds t beat market isn t difficult smart investors aum high unable invest easy wins smaller market cap companies buffet said victim success know 200 m company certainly going bring market beating returns 5 years managing 1bn dollars doesn t matter worse analysis better investor analyst 1 read post subreddit carvana highway bankruptcy half decent analysis written mind value investor comment post asking op price buy carvana stock op answered price fundamentally illustrates doesn t matter good analyst don t guts value investing single stock world worth purchasing right price company 95 likely bankrupt close doors 1 year price upside year non bankruptcy outcome 100x ev investment s mention good company lands position market priced failure failure highly unlikely,comment,ValueInvesting,2024-05-18 08:43:09,,OP,1,NASDAQ,1991,346,2024-05-18,8,Saturday

The trend in their growth metrics doesn't indicate they are capitalizing on their moat, if they have one.

l0jpupm,"I am bearish on Apple for a few reasons.

1. The limitations we are hitting with silicon chips are going to hit hardware oriented companies the most. Apple is the most hardware skewed big tech company. We are already seeing it in the latest generation of iPhone, where the main selling point was the Titanium case. The marketing department is grasping at straws. Their new ARM based desktop/laptop CPU's benefited heavily by buying up all of TSMC 5nm capacity, and milking the last drops of fabrication process advantage. That strategy is already over. Hardware is at the precipice, and everyone seems to be completely sleeping on this ENORMOUS elephant in the room.

*Sidenote: I have seen so many people argue that there are lots of other ways to get performance improvements out of CPU's without just shrinking transistor. If there were, they would be used already. There is no reason to save them for a rainy day. If Intel could stack chips and make 3D chips, or any other sort of strategy....they would have used it when they got stuck on 14nm 3 years ago.*

2. They are just the iPhone company. That is it. Look at the revenue breakdowns of big tech, Apple's is on of the worst for having all their egg's in a single basket. Their iPhone fort is also being attacked on all side by regulators.

3. Lastly, they are no longer an innovator but a follower. When they cancelled the Apple Car project, are reallocated those resources to AI, it was a shocking signal. What they essentially implied was ""We had this one strategy....it sucked. Now other tech companies have shown which way we should have gone, now lets pivot and chase the innovators"".

Apple is mediocre. Can their wads of cash be used to gain their former form...maybe.

Old habits die hard, and everyone is going to yell at me because AAPL has printed money for so long....but nothing lasts forever.

If VOO goes down moderately but not to your strike price ($485) you get $0 for the option and lost money in the market. So a 2% drop for VOO means a 4.8% drop for you. Your hedge only begins to work once VOO is below $485. You only begin effectively hedging at $471.20.

A low fee is important as even a 1% difference can add up to tens of thousands of pounds lost in fees over the course of a long investment. This [fund](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-lifestrategy-100-equity-fund-accumulation-shares/overview) for example has an ongoing charge of 0.22%. 

I would advise a fund if you’re looking for an 8% return. Buying a fund means you own a part of all the companies listed on the stock market. The stock market goes up over time, so the fund goes up too. I would strongly advise not to pick individual stocks yourself. You will probably lose your investment.

You want to have most of not all of your investment in shares and not bonds if you are young. They have higher returns. When you get to 40+, perhaps consider bonds as they’re generally considered less risky.

lwzzmzp,"Does this count as a capital loss? (Stock Market Newbie who got RSU's here)


So, I was granted $5k in RSU's earlier this year when my company went public, a congratulations gift I guess. I was confused at the time, because I'd never heard of getting a dollar number amount of shares, just a set number of shares. So I figured that however many shares that ended up being, would be based on their value when they vested on January 1st 2025. (I'm in a lockup period until Feb 8th).

  
Well now, when I logged into Shareworks for the first time today to see what was going on with my RSU's since the vesting day is coming up, not only is there a set number of shares in the account, but the selling price of each share has more than HALFED the price at IPO. So my supposed $5k gift from the company, is now only \~$2200, AND DROPPING, before they've even vested.

  
I'm literally so upset, since I was planning on selling those stocks as soon as I got them (because obviously, I know absolutely nothing about the stock market and honestly, want nothing to do with it lol), and putting that towards a cross-country move with my husband. Really freaking wish they had just given me a $5k bonus outright lol

  
All that preamble though is mainly to ask, will this at least count as a capital loss if I sell after the blackout period ends so I can at least get an upside on my tax return? I know capital loss is considered when a stock is sold for less than it was purchased, so will the purchase price at least be what it was at IPO when I was given the  ""award""? Or is the purchase price going to be the price of the stocks when they vest?

Nobody really expected Apple to do much of anything because they were completely bailed out by Microsoft and the only reason Microsoft bailed them out was to help against all of the antitrust issues that they were having.

A financial perk ?....if things were means tested, which they aren't, it might be a game changer. But other comments have stated financial and tax implications as to why it wouldn't work also. I just ran with the social input from experience.

I think, ultimately, people make choices. Within the frame work of society. That's the rules we play by in the game of life. If the choices don't work out it's on you to fix then. It's nobody else's fault.

If you keep doing the same thing the same way. You'll always have the same result.

Currently, with interest rates at 7%+ many franchisees of JIB, McDonalds, Taco Bell, Wendys, etc. are in an unfavorable position when it comes to building new locations or paying off existing debts as each of these businesses requires 2+m to build out. In low interest circumstances you would be buying these properties at a return of 5-6% return with leases extending 15-20 years. Currently its 7-8% return with 10-20 year leases and if you buy them from franchisees who have 20+ locations in bulk it can lead to returns around 9-10% per location for us and a relief for them on their loan balance. If you know what you're doing you'll look at the area for the factors you believe produce long term success, you make sure there is a fair rent to sales ratios, strong store sales, check the franchisees financial health, rent replacement risk, etc. More work than owning stocks but safer and easier to predict returns if you know the business.

kzjt4ej,"The problem with conditional trading is that there is always a pattern that fucks you, and it fucks you hard

The solution to risk management is not conditional trades like a stop loss but a hedged counter position.

Buy out of the money puts that a very cheap that covers your position.

As an example you have $100 position you spend $2 for puts that get in the money when your primary position goes below $80.

Let’s compare two scenarios, one the position goes to $60 and another it goes to $60 and then back up to $100.

With a stop loss protection at $80 in the first scenario you’d sell at $80 and have saved $20. In the second scenario you’d sell at $80 and then if you bought back in at $100, so even though the stock is the same price as when you started you lost $20.

With a covered put in the first scenario you pay $2 for the put, and it becomes worth $40 when your main position goes to $60, so you end up at $98 or a $2 loss on a $40 drop, and you don’t have to sell your position which is good for taxes.

If it goes down to $60 and back to $100, you never sold so your main position is worth $100, and the put is worth nothing and you paid $2 for it so a $2 loss.

If the stock goes down to $80, your put would be worthless and you’d have the maximum loss for the position. You can tailor your maximum loss to your preferences by choosing the right put, just know that the higher your maximum loss you can tolerate the cheaper the put will be which will reduce the friction of that $2 fee over time.


For me personally: I just buy and hold my positions without any risk protection.",problem conditional trading pattern fucks fucks hard solution risk management conditional trades like stop loss hedged counter position buy money puts cheap covers position example 100 position spend 2 puts money primary position goes 80 let s compare scenarios position goes 60 goes 60 100 stop loss protection 80 scenario d sell 80 saved 20 second scenario d sell 80 bought 100 stock price started lost 20 covered scenario pay 2 worth 40 main position goes 60 end 98 2 loss 40 drop don t sell position good taxes goes 60 100 sold main position worth 100 worth paid 2 2 loss stock goes 80 worthless d maximum loss position tailor maximum loss preferences choosing right know higher maximum loss tolerate cheaper reduce friction 2 fee time personally buy hold positions risk protection,comment,investing,2024-04-14 16:16:14,,,0,,1600,316,2024-04-14,16,Sunday

l4l0swz,"I had similar argument and I was holding your exact position over the matter.

ETFs are just good are reducing risks while profiting an ever growing economy, which will push the global stockmarket up. So diversifying broadly through World ETF and SPY 500 will guarantee to catch the increase while diluting the benefits of stronger components with safer components. In brief, in a well diversified ETF, all you achieve is to reduce your potential gains while also reducing your risk of loss.

Meanwhile, investing on individual stocks imply of course a higher volatility but also a better potential for changes, if through rigorous studies of quantitative data (financial analysis, market future perspective...) and qualitative data (ie. strategic guidance, future area of development...) you identify potential for growth, you are likely to gave a better ROI.

Now, the main reason why I don't value ETFs over individual stocks is because, at the end an ETF is always ""multiple individual stocks"" however I don't have the time to research them all, some ETF are fully transparent on their fund repartition and it may not match my preferred spread. There is always some shady sh!t companies in it, that has no room for growth but won't plunge (or just steadily) that only purpose is to ""stabilize"" the overall index. And finally, by buying an ETF you delegate your share voting right to the trading company (such as vanguard or such) which may parasyte the strategic decisions.

By focusing on individual stocks you can better research and monitor them, which further reinforce your comprehension of the stock while finding more ""rationality"" in the so-called irrational market, because at the end, the volume traded are not so much mirrored on financial performance than they are just the mirror of human psychological behavior and beliefs.

Lastly, next time someone tells you your 100% ROI is pure luck, just remember ""it happens once call it luck, if it happens twice, call it talent"", 18 months is a Ling enough time to not be sonely the result of luck. Flipping a coin can only get you so far before your come back to the 1:1 ratio, so after X amount of transactions you can call it ""expertise"". Thinking otherwise would just be denying the fact that we can learn from trading activities (since it's apparently only a matter of luck), and that's just the easy way for justifying mediocrity. His ROI was mediocre compared to yours, and that's the root of his choice for ""easiness"" over real dedication to learn and risk-taking behavior.
